## Statement from Los Angeles health department about bird flu and cats

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Los Angeles Department of Public Health spokesperson
- **Date:** received January 8, 2025

> Of the 7 cats confirmed with H5 Bird Flu in LA County, 5 of them have been linked to Raw Farm, LLC milk product and 1 has been linked to Monarch Raw Pet Food. The source of infection for the 7th cat is still under investigation.
>  
> Please note additional cats in households with these confirmed cases may have fallen ill or died, but testing was not possible for all cats.
>  
> There has been no clear demonstration of transmission of H5 bird flu virus from a sick cat to another cat or animal in these cases, nor have there been any known cases of transmission of H5 bird flu from cat to human in these cases. We strongly recommend that pet owners do not consume nor feed their pets raw milk, raw dairy, raw meat, raw poultry, or raw pet food.

- **Date:** received January 8, 2025

> 1) I know several states have reported large increases in norovirus outbreaks compared to previous years. Is that the case in Idaho?
> 
> We have observed a considerable increase in the cases of norovirus reported during 2024 compared with previous years.
> 
> 2) Has Idaho also seen an increase in GII.17 outbreaks, as has been reported elsewhere? 
> 
> We don’t have enough laboratory characterization data to confirm whether the increase in cases is caused by the norovirus GII.17 strain.

## Email from Marion Koopmans about new norovirus strain

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** Marion Koopmans, head of the Earsmus MC Department of Virology
- **Date:** received January 7, 2025

> We do indeed see that there is a genotype of norovirus (GII17) that seems to become dominant this season. It also has been observed in Europe.  There is insufficient surveillance (in my view) to really make the case that this is causing an increase in the number of cases, as we have a lot of norovirus infections each winter and the surveillance is rather patchy. 
> 
> What we are seeing has happened before for noroviruses. Noroviruses are very diverse.   Based on the virus composition, they are grouped into genotypes.  Over the past decade, genotype GII4 viruses have been observed most often as causes of outbreaks, for instance (although if you do more in depth studies, a greater diversity of viruses is seen).  Recently, viruses of a different genotype, GII17, have started to take over. It is possible that that is associated with an increase in illness reports, but we would need studies to actually proof that that is the case.

## Email from a Wisconsin spokesperson about the new norovirus strain

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** Elizabeth Goodsitt, Wisconsin Department of Health Services spokesperson
- **Date:** received January 7, 2025

> The new dominant strain is norovirus GII.17[P17] – speaking out loud, you would say “G two seventeen, P seventeen.” The previous dominant strain was norovirus GII.4 Sydney[P16].
> 
> I checked with Dr. Roberts, who says the names of specific subtypes of norovirus are usually only helpful for epidemiologists and folks that do research on norovirus. For all intents and purposes, there is little/no difference between norovirus strains. They all cause the same symptoms, have the same incubation period and length of illness, etc. The primary reason we keep track of these strains is so we know what is circulating so that when a new strain pops up like this one, we can catch it. Historically, a new strain can be associated with more cases and outbreaks, but it’s not because new strains cause new symptoms or have new features. It can be because folks in the community will not have any immunity to a new strain, making it easier to spread and easier to make more people sick.
> 
> It does not change any recommendations about prevention or spread. It just means we have a robust outbreak season and therefore an opportunity to really emphasize the importance of handwashing, staying home while sick and until at least 48 hours after recovery, etc.

## Email from a CDC scientist about the new norovirus strain

- **Source:** emails

- **Date:** received January 7, 2025

> Here are the latest data (September 1, 2024 – December 31, 2024 uploaded to CaliciNet  https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/php/reporting/calicinet-data.html which is our national norovirus surveillance system based on lab-data including typing of the viruses, which during the last couple of months is dominated by GII.17. During previous norovirus seasons (since 2012/2013), GII.4 Sydney was the predominant norovirus strain associated with at least 50-60% of all norovirus outbreaks every year. It is too early to tell if this strain is associated with more severe norovirus disease but likely lower population immunity is the reason for the early surge of an otherwise seasonal increase of this virus. Hope this helps.
> 
> ...
> 
> _Very helpful, thank you. If you'll permit a follow up: do you know if there is any regional difference for GII.17[P17]'s dominance this season so far, or does it appear to be prevalent around the country?_
> 
> ...
> 
> It’s everywhere including on cruise ship outbreaks

## Statement about FDA's response to bird flu in pet food

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Food and Drug Administration spokesperson
- **Date:** received January 3, 2025

> The FDA and state authorities routinely work together to surveil the animal food supply, including pet food. This includes conducting risk-based facility inspections and collecting animal food samples to help ensure safety.  The FDA may also collect samples “for cause,” such as when a pet food is suspected of being associated with human or animal illness. State authorities also regularly collect samples from retail settings and share test results with the agency. HPAI is an emerging contaminant in animal food. Analytical capacity is limited and pathogens like H5N1 can be difficult to detect because they might not be evenly distributed throughout the product (increasing the possibility of a false negative result). 
> 
> Part of a pet food manufacturer’s responsibility is to bring a safe, wholesome product to market that is not adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. As we learn more about the transmission of H5N1 in animal food, there are several practices that the FDA is encouraging pet food manufacturers and others in the supply chain to use to prevent HPAI transmission through animal food. These practices could include seeking poultry from flocks that are documented as having remained healthy throughout processing, and taking processing steps, such as heat treatment, that are capable of inactivating viruses and other hazards.   
> 
> All recent detections of H5N1 in cats had these things in common: the infected cats ate wild birds, unpasteurized milk, raw poultry, and/or raw poultry pet food. We know that cats are particularly sensitive to HPAI, and that very young, very old or immune-compromised animals are at greater risk of infection. The FDA continues to recommend that consumers avoid feeding pets any products that are recalled or from affected farms if those products have not been thoroughly cooked or pasteurized to inactivate the virus. If consumers are unsure of the origin of those products, it’s safest to follow the USDA guidelines for handling and thorough cooking before feeding. Animals should also be kept from hunting and eating wild birds.

- **Date:** received January 2, 2025

> Hi, Alexander: Below please find a graph showing the OHSU Health system daily census for patients with the flu, from 11/1/2018 to present. You can see that in Dec. 2022, we also had a very large spike in flu cases, but this year has been significantly higher than last year. Below the graph is a chart with real numbers from the different facilities that make up OHSU Health. You can see that in 2023, the system treated 251 cases of flu, and in 2024, it jumped to 1,101 cases.
> 
> In 2022, the combination of RSV, flu and COVID led to a public health emergency and crisis standards of care among hospitals in the region. We have not experienced that, and do not currently expect to, this year.
> 
> ...
> 
> One more piece of data that I just received to home in on just the OHSU hospital emergency department: The ED saw a big jump from 2023 in December alone.

## Email about CDC's norovirus outbreak data

- **Date:** received January 3, 2025

> Data from the NoroSTAT network are typically released monthly online; we expect to release the next update mid-month.
> 
> NoroSTAT figures represent the total number of suspected and confirmed norovirus outbreaks reported each week to CDC by the state health departments in Alabama, Colorado, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin through the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS). CDC does not routinely publish the location of norovirus outbreaks and defers to state and local health departments for additional data and messaging on outbreaks within their jurisdictions.
