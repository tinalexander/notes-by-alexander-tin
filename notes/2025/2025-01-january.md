> Hi, Alexander: Below please find a graph showing the OHSU Health system daily census for patients with the flu, from 11/1/2018 to present. You can see that in Dec. 2022, we also had a very large spike in flu cases, but this year has been significantly higher than last year. Below the graph is a chart with real numbers from the different facilities that make up OHSU Health. You can see that in 2023, the system treated 251 cases of flu, and in 2024, it jumped to 1,101 cases.

> Data from the NoroSTAT network are typically released monthly online; we expect to release the next update mid-month.
> 
> NoroSTAT figures represent the total number of suspected and confirmed norovirus outbreaks reported each week to CDC by the state health departments in Alabama, Colorado, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin through the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS). CDC does not routinely publish the location of norovirus outbreaks and defers to state and local health departments for additional data and messaging on outbreaks within their jurisdictions.
