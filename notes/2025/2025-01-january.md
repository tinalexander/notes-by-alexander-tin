> Peter Marks, FDA [00:11:15]
> 
> One of the issues comes up about is how often should we change these vaccine strains? And there are really some practical considerations that limit our ability to change vaccine composition. 
> 
> One of them is just manufacturing constraints. You can only change the process so many times, and because there's a whole process involved, and that limits things. 
> 
> And the other issue though, it's true, is that we, it's hard to get data to suggest when you should actually do so, because in many cases, as we've seen already with the XEC variant, an existing vaccine seems to cover them pretty well. So you don't want to change until you have data that suggests that your current vaccine is not actually working well. 
> 
> So this is some of the challenges that we deal with.
> 
> Right now we are anticipating that we will continue to update these vaccines and we'll be choosing a strain next May, June for next year. 
> 
> With the obvious caveat that if something were to materialize that were a very serious escape variant, we could potentially mobilize to pick a variant more rapidly in a similar way that we've done for influenza viruses in the past, where, in part, because of the rapidity of the mRNA process, it could potentially only take a few months before we could have a new vaccine, if we needed to deploy one on the order of about three months, if it were necessary.
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [00:27:32]
> 
> So this is a comparison using our national immunization survey of what we are seeing among older adults. 
> 
> This is 75 plus in the United States this year in terms of vaccination coverage. The light blue line is last season. So 2023 and 24. And you can see that we plateaued somewhere around 40% for coverage all said and done in the season. 
> 
> And so when you are looking at this slide, a couple things are notable. 
> 
> One because of the earlier availability of vaccine, these individuals were able to start getting vaccinated in early September rather than late September. And we are seeing climbs that are higher than what we saw last year. So in fact, today we're at about 49%, which is higher than the plateau for last year. So that is a really encouraging trend. 
> 
> And that is especially encouraging, given the data that I showed you previously about the risk of death and hospitalization for individuals who are more advanced in years. And we're going to define that, for the purpose of this presentation as over 75. 
> 
> So there's a lot of reasons that this may be going on. 
> 
> Again, first it could be because of COVID vaccines were available several weeks earlier this season. That may mean that folks were able to sync this closer to their flu vaccine. 
> 
> Second, our early data from September suggest that more older adults are receiving both of these together. So in fact, we do have some data that COVID and flu vaccines, co-administration at least in pharmacies also appears to be increased compared to last year. 
> 
> And then additionally, we are seeing, in our national immunization survey from October that older adults have increased concern about COVID 19. So the findings that we have about severe outcomes, like those are passing over to them because of their concern. They have a greater intention to receive the vaccine. 
> 
> And then lastly, because of the work that you do, healthcare providers are increasingly recommending the COVID 19 vaccine to this population. And so all really important and also really important to protect one population that may have a risk of some of the worst outcomes of COVID 19.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:38:33]
> 
> Do you have any forecasting when it's likely that the pediatric COVID 19 vaccines will get full FDA approval?
> 
> Peter Marks, FDA [00:38:40]
> 
> It's always, this is all obviously commercial confidential information, but I would suspect that we're looking at something that's on the matter of months away, not years away.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:44:09]
> 
> Peter, can you comment on the LP.8.1 variant? Do we know how it compares with XEC and whether we expect different protection?
> 
> Peter Marks, FDA [00:44:19]
> 
> So we'll need to get that. That's one where we're going to need to get data. 
> 
> And that's part of what I was talking about. This challenge for us is to keep up with this. 
> 
> We do keep up, which is that as we get these variants, we start to test them and get them into the testing process. 
> 
> But again, we will keep-- and we'll keep chasing them. 
> 
> So far we've been pretty lucky in finding that these have been generally covered by the current strains that we're covering with with either JN.1 or KP.2, but we'll keep testing.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:52:32]
> 
> There have been some concerns about vaccine being available in the summer surge of disease. Do we foresee any further changes in kind of the timing of our recommendations, authorization of new seasonal vaccine for COVID vaccine going forward?
> 
> Peter Marks, FDA [00:52:51]
> 
> Yeah, so, I mean, this is something that we will, this is why we monitor the epidemiology pretty closely. 
> 
> I think if we were to, as we come into the May June timeframe, if we were to start to see a surge, with a new variant that we did not think was well covered, we might try to move up as much as we could the availability of the next season's vaccine. 
> 
> So there's a little bit of an art to this still because it's not perfect seasonality as Dr. Daskalakis showed. So we're just gonna have to watch this closely. 
> 
> We may get lucky, and if there's a summer surge, it'll be with the same, something that's covered well with the same vaccine. If not, we have this opportunity, particularly with the mRNA vaccine technology to really crank out vaccine pretty quickly, in order to try to address an emerging variant a little sooner.

> Of the 7 cats confirmed with H5 Bird Flu in LA County, 5 of them have been linked to Raw Farm, LLC milk product and 1 has been linked to Monarch Raw Pet Food. The source of infection for the 7th cat is still under investigation.
>  
> Please note additional cats in households with these confirmed cases may have fallen ill or died, but testing was not possible for all cats.
>  
> There has been no clear demonstration of transmission of H5 bird flu virus from a sick cat to another cat or animal in these cases, nor have there been any known cases of transmission of H5 bird flu from cat to human in these cases. We strongly recommend that pet owners do not consume nor feed their pets raw milk, raw dairy, raw meat, raw poultry, or raw pet food.

> 1) I know several states have reported large increases in norovirus outbreaks compared to previous years. Is that the case in Idaho?
> 
> We have observed a considerable increase in the cases of norovirus reported during 2024 compared with previous years.
> 
> 2) Has Idaho also seen an increase in GII.17 outbreaks, as has been reported elsewhere? 
> 
> We don’t have enough laboratory characterization data to confirm whether the increase in cases is caused by the norovirus GII.17 strain.

## Email from Marion Koopmans about new norovirus strain

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** Marion Koopmans, head of the Earsmus MC Department of Virology
- **Date:** received January 7, 2025

> We do indeed see that there is a genotype of norovirus (GII17) that seems to become dominant this season. It also has been observed in Europe.  There is insufficient surveillance (in my view) to really make the case that this is causing an increase in the number of cases, as we have a lot of norovirus infections each winter and the surveillance is rather patchy. 
> 
> What we are seeing has happened before for noroviruses. Noroviruses are very diverse.   Based on the virus composition, they are grouped into genotypes.  Over the past decade, genotype GII4 viruses have been observed most often as causes of outbreaks, for instance (although if you do more in depth studies, a greater diversity of viruses is seen).  Recently, viruses of a different genotype, GII17, have started to take over. It is possible that that is associated with an increase in illness reports, but we would need studies to actually proof that that is the case.

## Email from a Wisconsin spokesperson about the new norovirus strain

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** Elizabeth Goodsitt, Wisconsin Department of Health Services spokesperson
- **Date:** received January 7, 2025

> The new dominant strain is norovirus GII.17[P17] – speaking out loud, you would say “G two seventeen, P seventeen.” The previous dominant strain was norovirus GII.4 Sydney[P16].
> 
> I checked with Dr. Roberts, who says the names of specific subtypes of norovirus are usually only helpful for epidemiologists and folks that do research on norovirus. For all intents and purposes, there is little/no difference between norovirus strains. They all cause the same symptoms, have the same incubation period and length of illness, etc. The primary reason we keep track of these strains is so we know what is circulating so that when a new strain pops up like this one, we can catch it. Historically, a new strain can be associated with more cases and outbreaks, but it’s not because new strains cause new symptoms or have new features. It can be because folks in the community will not have any immunity to a new strain, making it easier to spread and easier to make more people sick.
> 
> It does not change any recommendations about prevention or spread. It just means we have a robust outbreak season and therefore an opportunity to really emphasize the importance of handwashing, staying home while sick and until at least 48 hours after recovery, etc.

## Email from a CDC scientist about the new norovirus strain

- **Source:** emails

- **Date:** received January 7, 2025

> Here are the latest data (September 1, 2024 – December 31, 2024 uploaded to CaliciNet  https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/php/reporting/calicinet-data.html which is our national norovirus surveillance system based on lab-data including typing of the viruses, which during the last couple of months is dominated by GII.17. During previous norovirus seasons (since 2012/2013), GII.4 Sydney was the predominant norovirus strain associated with at least 50-60% of all norovirus outbreaks every year. It is too early to tell if this strain is associated with more severe norovirus disease but likely lower population immunity is the reason for the early surge of an otherwise seasonal increase of this virus. Hope this helps.
> 
> ...
> 
> _Very helpful, thank you. If you'll permit a follow up: do you know if there is any regional difference for GII.17[P17]'s dominance this season so far, or does it appear to be prevalent around the country?_
> 
> ...
> 
> It’s everywhere including on cruise ship outbreaks

## Statement about FDA's response to bird flu in pet food

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Food and Drug Administration spokesperson
- **Date:** received January 3, 2025

> The FDA and state authorities routinely work together to surveil the animal food supply, including pet food. This includes conducting risk-based facility inspections and collecting animal food samples to help ensure safety.  The FDA may also collect samples “for cause,” such as when a pet food is suspected of being associated with human or animal illness. State authorities also regularly collect samples from retail settings and share test results with the agency. HPAI is an emerging contaminant in animal food. Analytical capacity is limited and pathogens like H5N1 can be difficult to detect because they might not be evenly distributed throughout the product (increasing the possibility of a false negative result). 
> 
> Part of a pet food manufacturer’s responsibility is to bring a safe, wholesome product to market that is not adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. As we learn more about the transmission of H5N1 in animal food, there are several practices that the FDA is encouraging pet food manufacturers and others in the supply chain to use to prevent HPAI transmission through animal food. These practices could include seeking poultry from flocks that are documented as having remained healthy throughout processing, and taking processing steps, such as heat treatment, that are capable of inactivating viruses and other hazards.   
> 
> All recent detections of H5N1 in cats had these things in common: the infected cats ate wild birds, unpasteurized milk, raw poultry, and/or raw poultry pet food. We know that cats are particularly sensitive to HPAI, and that very young, very old or immune-compromised animals are at greater risk of infection. The FDA continues to recommend that consumers avoid feeding pets any products that are recalled or from affected farms if those products have not been thoroughly cooked or pasteurized to inactivate the virus. If consumers are unsure of the origin of those products, it’s safest to follow the USDA guidelines for handling and thorough cooking before feeding. Animals should also be kept from hunting and eating wild birds.

- **Date:** received January 2, 2025

> Hi, Alexander: Below please find a graph showing the OHSU Health system daily census for patients with the flu, from 11/1/2018 to present. You can see that in Dec. 2022, we also had a very large spike in flu cases, but this year has been significantly higher than last year. Below the graph is a chart with real numbers from the different facilities that make up OHSU Health. You can see that in 2023, the system treated 251 cases of flu, and in 2024, it jumped to 1,101 cases.
> 
> In 2022, the combination of RSV, flu and COVID led to a public health emergency and crisis standards of care among hospitals in the region. We have not experienced that, and do not currently expect to, this year.
> 
> ...
> 
> One more piece of data that I just received to home in on just the OHSU hospital emergency department: The ED saw a big jump from 2023 in December alone.

## Email about CDC's norovirus outbreak data

- **Date:** received January 3, 2025

> Data from the NoroSTAT network are typically released monthly online; we expect to release the next update mid-month.
> 
> NoroSTAT figures represent the total number of suspected and confirmed norovirus outbreaks reported each week to CDC by the state health departments in Alabama, Colorado, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin through the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS). CDC does not routinely publish the location of norovirus outbreaks and defers to state and local health departments for additional data and messaging on outbreaks within their jurisdictions.
