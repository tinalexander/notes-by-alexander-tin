## Email about the emergence of a new norovirus strain

> Here are the latest data (September 1, 2024 – December 31, 2024 uploaded to CaliciNet  https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/php/reporting/calicinet-data.html which is our national norovirus surveillance system based on lab-data including typing of the viruses, which during the last couple of months is dominated by GII.17. During previous norovirus seasons (since 2012/2013), GII.4 Sydney was the predominant norovirus strain associated with at least 50-60% of all norovirus outbreaks every year. It is too early to tell if this strain is associated with more severe norovirus disease but likely lower population immunity is the reason for the early surge of an otherwise seasonal increase of this virus. Hope this helps.

## Statement about FDA's response to bird flu in pet food

> The FDA and state authorities routinely work together to surveil the animal food supply, including pet food. This includes conducting risk-based facility inspections and collecting animal food samples to help ensure safety.  The FDA may also collect samples “for cause,” such as when a pet food is suspected of being associated with human or animal illness. State authorities also regularly collect samples from retail settings and share test results with the agency. HPAI is an emerging contaminant in animal food. Analytical capacity is limited and pathogens like H5N1 can be difficult to detect because they might not be evenly distributed throughout the product (increasing the possibility of a false negative result). 
> 
> Part of a pet food manufacturer’s responsibility is to bring a safe, wholesome product to market that is not adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. As we learn more about the transmission of H5N1 in animal food, there are several practices that the FDA is encouraging pet food manufacturers and others in the supply chain to use to prevent HPAI transmission through animal food. These practices could include seeking poultry from flocks that are documented as having remained healthy throughout processing, and taking processing steps, such as heat treatment, that are capable of inactivating viruses and other hazards.   
> 
> All recent detections of H5N1 in cats had these things in common: the infected cats ate wild birds, unpasteurized milk, raw poultry, and/or raw poultry pet food. We know that cats are particularly sensitive to HPAI, and that very young, very old or immune-compromised animals are at greater risk of infection. The FDA continues to recommend that consumers avoid feeding pets any products that are recalled or from affected farms if those products have not been thoroughly cooked or pasteurized to inactivate the virus. If consumers are unsure of the origin of those products, it’s safest to follow the USDA guidelines for handling and thorough cooking before feeding. Animals should also be kept from hunting and eating wild birds.

## Email about influenza trends at an Oregon hospital

> Hi, Alexander: Below please find a graph showing the OHSU Health system daily census for patients with the flu, from 11/1/2018 to present. You can see that in Dec. 2022, we also had a very large spike in flu cases, but this year has been significantly higher than last year. Below the graph is a chart with real numbers from the different facilities that make up OHSU Health. You can see that in 2023, the system treated 251 cases of flu, and in 2024, it jumped to 1,101 cases.
> 
> In 2022, the combination of RSV, flu and COVID led to a public health emergency and crisis standards of care among hospitals in the region. We have not experienced that, and do not currently expect to, this year.

> One more piece of data that I just received to home in on just the OHSU hospital emergency department: The ED saw a big jump from 2023 in December alone.

## Email about CDC's norovirus outbreak data

- **Date:** received January 3, 2025

> Data from the NoroSTAT network are typically released monthly online; we expect to release the next update mid-month.
> 
> NoroSTAT figures represent the total number of suspected and confirmed norovirus outbreaks reported each week to CDC by the state health departments in Alabama, Colorado, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin through the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS). CDC does not routinely publish the location of norovirus outbreaks and defers to state and local health departments for additional data and messaging on outbreaks within their jurisdictions.
