## CDC spokesperson on D1.1 in human in Nevada

- **Date:** received February 10, 2025

> Attributable to a CDC Spokesperson
> 
> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed a human infection with avian influenza A(H5) (H5 bird flu) in Nevada. This infection happened in a dairy worker with exposure to dairy cows experiencing an outbreak of H5 bird flu as reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The person experienced conjunctivitis (eye redness and irritation). This case involving cow-to-human spread of H5 in a person with higher-risk occupational exposure does not change CDC’s risk assessment, which remains low for the public but is higher for people with occupational or recreational exposures. 
> 
> CDC will continue to provide updates as additional information becomes available. For more information, read the Central Nevada Health District statement.
> 
> Background information 
> 
> The individual in Nevada reported experiencing conjunctivitis, similar to most cases associated with dairy cows to date who had mild respiratory symptoms or conjunctivitis. The person did not need to be hospitalized and is recovering. 
> 
> USDA has identified H5 viruses in dairy cows in Nevada as having the D1.1 genotype, the predominant virus in migratory birds. CDC’s full genome analysis of the virus from the human case in Nevada confirms that is the same virus as that found in the cows (D1.1). Based on available data this same virus likely infected 15 people in Iowa, Louisiana, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin during 2024. This virus (D1.1) is different from the virus (B3.13) that caused the dairy cow outbreaks and the majority of human infections in the United States to date. The majority of human infections in the United States have been mild irrespective of the H5 genotype, with the exception of the fatal case in Louisiana last year in a person who had prolonged, unprotected exposure to infected backyard birds.  
> 
> The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported on February 7 that H5 viruses identified in some dairy cows in Nevada contain a genetic mutation in the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) protein that has previously been associated with more efficient virus replication in people and other mammals (i.e., change of PB2 D701N). CDC’s analysis of sequence data from the human case in Nevada found this same mutation. This change was previously identified in a human case in Chile in 2023. No other changes associated with mammalian adaption were identified in the sequence data from the human case in Nevada. CDC also did not identify any changes in the sequence data that might impact antigenicity or susceptibility to antivirals. However, the virus will undergo further analysis and testing.  
> 
> There is currently no evidence of person-to-person spread of H5N1 bird flu from this individual in Nevada to others. Combined with the mild nature of the individual’s illness, this case does not change CDC’s low risk assessment for the public. The risk assessment for H5 could change as more information about this case becomes available or as additional cases are detected. Influenza viruses constantly change, requiring continued surveillance and preparedness efforts. CDC is taking measures to be ready in case the current risk assessment for the public changes. 
> 
> This development underscores the importance of recommended precautions in people with exposure to infected or potentially infected animals, including use of appropriate personal protective equipment. People with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected cows, birds, or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected cows, birds, or other animals, are at greater risk of infection.

> _I read that the department thinks the virus spilled over from wild birds into cows independently at multiple dairies, as opposed to spreading between dairies. Is that right?_
> 
> ...
> 
> We believe the initial infection came from spillover from wild birds. We are still conducting our epidemiology study to determine how it is being spread between dairies.

## CDC spokesperson on whooping cough deaths in 2024

- **Source:** emailed statement

- **Date:** received February 10, 2025

> **********
> 
> “People of all ages are at risk for getting pertussis (whooping cough). Everyone who is not up to date with whooping cough vaccination should get vaccinated. Data for January 2025 are pending confirmation; However, we are aware of 12 confirmed whooping cough deaths in 2024.”
> 
> **********
> 
> Background Information:
> 
> Preliminary cases reported in 2024 are higher than cases for any year since 2014, but this is expected. Whooping cough is a cyclic disease, and the United States typically sees peaks in disease every 3-5 years; however, the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted typical whooping cough patterns. Additionally, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) modified the whooping cough case definition on January 1, 2020. The changes were made to help improve case identification, which could lead to increased case counts. The 2020 CSTE case definition can be viewed here: https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/pertussis-2020/. Reported cases continue to remain elevated in 2025.
> 
> Babies are at greatest risk for have severe complications from whooping cough. Most whooping cough deaths are in babies younger than 3 months old―too young to be protected by having received their own vaccines. Vaccinating pregnant women with a whooping cough vaccine (Tdap) is the most important thing we can do to help protect babies during their first few months of life, before they are old enough to get their own whooping cough vaccines.
> 
> While whooping cough typically isn’t a severe illness for teens and adults, complications are possible. Also, the coughing fits can last for weeks or months. Whooping cough is usually less severe for those who have been vaccinated. Learn more about whooping cough vaccine recommendations: Whooping Cough Vaccination  Whooping Cough  CDC.

- **Date:** received February 6, 2025

> Risk remains low despite what appears to be the introduction of a different genotype of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus into dairy cows based on the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Stakeholder Registry email. CDC continues to monitor this situation closely for signs that would indicate the risk to human health has changed.

## From a senior USAID official on changes

> This is the extent of the guidance we have for how we sort out our lives, plan our next steps, know how our senior can graduate from the school that is paid for or if we leave him behind somehow with trusted friends to do so, or how our 9yo knows when she says goodbye to her teachers and friends?
> 
> We are being traumatized without a plan, and for WHAT? There are ways to do this humanely and logically. If ppl think AID should be downsized, fine...do it legally, thoughtfully, and purposefully. And we are in a better situation than so many of our colleagues who we've worked alongside, who take great risks, and are just abandoned because of their hiring mechanism. This 90 day "review" that they said was going to happen... never was put out there in good faith. They've taken over our databases with our indicators and results, trying to keep us from accessing info to demonstrate the value of our work. Thev weren't fast enough though. So, now they know they were going to lose with any bs "90 day review" so they had to cut us off from all of it, including the treasury payments via the culty tech bro teenagers they're using so there is probably not even money to get us home. And I say this again, we are better off in this whole shitstorm than so many other people and families who are dedicating their lives to public service, diplomacy, humanitarian causes, saving lives, preventing coups, attacks....I'm so tired

> We are literally trained for how to survive hostile situations, and are prepared for that as much as we can be, but this is next level, especially because it's from our own country who we've taken oaths to serve

- **Date:** received February 5, 2025

> _How many herds are believed to have been infected linked to the outbreak?_
> 
> Detections of H5N1 have been made in dairy cattle in Nye County and Churchill County.
> 
> i.      The detection in Nye County was confirmed in December of 2024 as H5N1 B3.13. This herd was placed under quarantine at the first sign of illness and will remain under quarantine until they test negative for 3 consecutive weeks.
> 
>  ii.      Four detections in Churchill County have been confirmed as H5N1 D1.1 and were placed under quarantine. Two additional herds in Churchill County have been placed under quarantine with “non-negative” laboratory results at a National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) lab and are awaiting confirmation from the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory.
> 
> _Are you able to describe the kinds of symptoms that have been reported in cows?_
> 
> Symptoms of H5N1 D1.1 have been similar to the detections of B3.13. These include fever, reduced feed consumption, reduced milk production and mild respiratory signs (coughing, sneezing, runny nose).

> 
> _CDC staff have been unable to coordinate with WHO in Uganda's incident command to respond to the virus_
> 
> _CDC's usual meetings with state and local health officials and external stakeholders to share information about the outbreak have not occurred, amid the current communications pause_
> 
> _Appreciate anything you can share by 2 p.m. ET today._
>

## Senator Cassidy on decision to support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

- **Source:** livestream
- **Attribution:** Senate floor
- **Date:** occurred February 4, 2025

> Sen. Bill Cassidy [00:04:57]
> 
> Mr. Kennedy and the administration reached out seeking to reassure me regarding their commitment to protecting the public health benefit of vaccination.
> 
> To this end, Mr. Kennedy and the administration committed that he and I would have an unprecedentedly close, collaborative working relationship, if he is confirmed. We will meet or speak multiple times a month. This collaboration will allow us to work well together and therefore, to be more effective. 
> 
> Mr. Kennedy has asked for my input into hiring decisions at HHS beyond Senate confirmed positions. And this aspect of the collaboration will allow us to represent all sides of those folks who are contacting me over this past weekend. 
> 
> He has also committed that he would work within current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems and not establish parallel systems. 
> 
> If confirmed, he'll maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations without changes. 
> 
> CDC will not remove statements on their website pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism.
> 
> Mr. Kennedy and the administration also committed that this administration will not use the subversive techniques used under the Biden administration, like sue and settle, to change policies enacted by Congress without first going through Congress. 
> 
> Mr. Kennedy and the administration committed to a strong role of Congress. Aside from he and I meeting regularly, he will come before the HELP committee on a quarterly basis if requested.
> 
> He committed that the HELP committee chair, whether it's me or someone else, may choose a representative on any board or commission formed to review vaccine safety. 
> 
> If he is confirmed, HHS will provide a 30 day notice to the HELP committee if the agency seeks to make changes to any of our federal vaccine safety monitoring programs and HELP committee will have the option to call a hearing to further review. 
> 
> These commitments and my expectation that we can have a great working relationship to Make America Healthy Again is the basis of my support. 

## Senate Finance Committee vote on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

- **Source:** livestream
- **Attribution:** hosted by the Senate Finance Committee
- **Date:** occurred February 4, 2025

> 10:13:33 CRAPO: In response to members of the committee, Mr. Kennedy has even amended his ethics agreement going beyond what is required by the government office of ethics.
>
> Mr. Kennedy has proven his commitment to the role of secretary of the HHS. And I will vote in favor of his nomination.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:14:29 WYDEN: The last several days we've witnessed an authoritarian takeover of our federal government by Elon Musk and Donald Trump. 
> 
> They have set their sights on a full purge of anyone in government that doesn't bend the knee and follow their orders. 
> 
> They've taken over the Treasury Department's payment system. And colleagues, that has a direct effect on major programs within our committee's jurisdiction. 
> 
> That includes Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. 
> 
> For example, this committee voted for a major reform of pharmacy benefit manager legislation. We passed it 26 to nothing. But Trump and Musk killed it.
> 
> Think what they could do with abuse of the payment system. 
> 
> Now, in my view, much of this is of dubious legality and constitutional authority. And certainly flies in face of congressional responsibilities. 
> 
> I'll wrap up on this point by saying I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not sit by while Musk and Trump make a mockery of the power Republicans hold in their congressional majority. 
> 
> Now more than ever, the American people need leaders that will stand up to these abuses.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:19:08 WYDEN: Do senators want their legacy to include disregarding basic health science and instead elevate conspiracy theorists?
> 
> Making Robert Kennedy Secretary of Health and Human Services, in my view, colleagues, would be a grave threat to the health of the American people. 
> 
> And I urge my colleagues this morning to vote no.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:22:35 CANTWELL: So the most challenging-- I wanted to vote for Mr. Kennedy in the context of my family's history. 
> 
> My dad stood behind his father the night his father gave the famous speech. I told him in my office, in my family, the Kennedys stood up. 
> 
> But when he answered Senator Cassidy's question and he couldn't even give him the answer that, yes, the data is there to support vaccines today. 
> 
> I don't need any more data.
> 
> All of a sudden, I saw this world that we got affected by in Seattle not being stood up for.
> 
> I need someone at HHS who is going to say we are going to be a leader in medical technology, science, vaccines, we are going to fight foreign powers, we are going to be there to provide global health.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:24:46 WARNOCK: I simply do not trust him to oversee the CDC. 
> 
> He's unqualified, and I dare say everybody here knows it. We need a serious person at the helm of the HHS, an agency responsible for about half of the health-- of about half of all Americans. 
> 
> Mr. Kennedy appears more obsessed in chasing conspiracy theories than chasing solutions to lower health care costs for working families in Georgia and to make sure that we are protected. The last thing we need is a dilettante aabbling in conspiracy theories at HHS.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:33:04 WARREN: Since we had our hearing last week, Mr. Kennedy has amended his ethics agreement. 
> 
> Recall that his ethics agreement said that while he was secretary of HHS, he intended to retain a financial interest in ongoing vaccine litigation that he was already collecting money from. 
> 
> And that he wanted to continue to collect that money even though he could affect the outcome of that litigation. 
> 
> Now, he has since changed his position on that. Once this has been exposed and people have talked about it and have some pretty serious reservations about his doing that.
> 
> He has said that he will instead give his financial interest to his son. That is a fig leaf that is so small, it would take a magnifying glass to see it. 
> 
> No one is fooled about what's happening here. 
> 
> Mr. Kennedy refuses to say that he will not participate in these lawsuits financially the day after he leaves office. 
> 
> And yet, Mr. Kennedy has acknowledged first that the American people have a right to know that the decisions you're making are decisions that are in their interest not in your future financial interest. 
> 
> He has said he thinks that's the right standard, and yet he has figured out how to make money off his anti-vax positions. He's already raked in $2.5 million. 
> 
> He is in a position where he can affect the outcomes by things he does as Secretary of HHS. 
> 
> And yet he refuses to say that he will delay by even a day taking on anti-vax lawsuits the minute he leaves. 
> 
> That is an appalling conflict of interest, and it's one in which the American people can reasonably ask, is Mr. Kennedy's plan to help the American people? Or is he planning to use this job to further enrich himself? 
> 
> And he's pointed out with his son, and enrich his family. 
> 
> The importance of this litigation cannot be overstated. This is not only about a private company that gets sued and has to pay out. 
> 
> Vaccine manufacturers often operate on very slim profit margins. If they get sued repeatedly and successfully, they simply move out of the vaccine space. 
> 
> We've already seen this happen with vaccines in the past. 20 years ago, we watched vaccines just move away if they did not have protection from these kinds of lawsuits. 
> 
> The consequence of Mr. Kennedy's ability to make those lawsuits easier is also the ability to shut down access and manufacturing for vaccines for every one of us. And I think that's a terrible mistake.
