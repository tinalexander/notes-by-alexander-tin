## Senator Cassidy on decision to support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

- **Source:** livestream
- **Attribution:** Senate floor
- **Date:** occurred February 4, 2025

> Sen. Bill Cassidy [00:04:57]
> 
> Mr. Kennedy and the administration reached out seeking to reassure me regarding their commitment to protecting the public health benefit of vaccination.
> 
> To this end, Mr. Kennedy and the administration committed that he and I would have an unprecedentedly close, collaborative working relationship, if  he has confirmed.
> 
> We will meet or speak multiple times a month. This collaboration will allow us to work well together and therefore, to be more effective. 
> 
> Mr. Kennedy has asked for my input into hiring decisions at HHS beyond Senate confirmed positions. And this aspect of the collaboration will allow us to represent all sides of those folks who are contacting me over this past weekend. 
> 
> He has also committed that he would work within current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems and not establish parallel systems. 
> 
> If confirmed, he'll maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations without changes. 
> 
> CDC will not remove statements on their website pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism.
> 
> Mr. Kennedy and the administration also committed that this administration will not use the subversive techniques used under the Biden administration, like sue and settle, to change policies enacted by Congress without first going through Congress. 
> 
> Mr. Kennedy and the administration committed to a strong role of Congress. Aside from he and I meeting regularly, he will come before the HELP committee on a quarterly basis if requested.
> 
> He committed that the HELP committee chair, whether it's me or someone else, may choose a representative on any board or commission formed to review vaccine safety. 
> 
> If he is confirmed, HHS will provide a 30 day notice to the HELP committee if the agency seeks to make changes to any of our federal vaccine safety monitoring programs and HELP committee will have the option to call a hearing to further review. 
> 
> These commitments and my expectation that we can have a great working relationship to Make America Healthy Again is the basis of my support. 

## Senate Finance Committee vote on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

- **Source:** livestream
- **Attribution:** hosted by the Senate Finance Committee
- **Date:** occurred February 4, 2025

> 10:13:33 CRAPO: In response to members of the committee, Mr. Kennedy has even amended his ethics agreement going beyond what is required by the government office of ethics.
>
> Mr. Kennedy has proven his commitment to the role of secretary of the HHS. And I will vote in favor of his nomination.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:14:29 WYDEN: The last several days we've witnessed an authoritarian takeover of our federal government by Elon Musk and Donald Trump. 
> 
> They have set their sights on a full purge of anyone in government that doesn't bend the knee and follow their orders. 
> 
> They've taken over the Treasury Department's payment system. And colleagues, that has a direct effect on major programs within our committee's jurisdiction. 
> 
> That includes Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. 
> 
> For example, this committee voted for a major reform of pharmacy benefit manager legislation. We passed it 26 to nothing. But Trump and Musk killed it.
> 
> Think what they could do with abuse of the payment system. 
> 
> Now, in my view, much of this is of dubious legality and constitutional authority. And certainly flies in face of congressional responsibilities. 
> 
> I'll wrap up on this point by saying I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not sit by while Musk and Trump make a mockery of the power Republicans hold in their congressional majority. 
> 
> Now more than ever, the American people need leaders that will stand up to these abuses.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:19:08 WYDEN: Do senators want their legacy to include disregarding basic health science and instead elevate conspiracy theorists?
> 
> Making Robert Kennedy Secretary of Health and Human Services, in my view, colleagues, would be a grave threat to the health of the American people. 
> 
> And I urge my colleagues this morning to vote no.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:22:35 CANTWELL: So the most challenging-- I wanted to vote for Mr. Kennedy in the context of my family's history. 
> 
> My dad stood behind his father the night his father gave the famous speech. I told him in my office, in my family, the Kennedys stood up. 
> 
> But when he answered Senator Cassidy's question and he couldn't even give him the answer that, yes, the data is there to support vaccines today. 
> 
> I don't need any more data.
> 
> All of a sudden, I saw this world that we got affected by in Seattle not being stood up for.
> 
> I need someone at HHS who is going to say we are going to be a leader in medical technology, science, vaccines, we are going to fight foreign powers, we are going to be there to provide global health.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:24:46 WARNOCK: I simply do not trust him to oversee the CDC. 
> 
> He's unqualified, and I dare say everybody here knows it. We need a serious person at the helm of the HHS, an agency responsible for about half of the health-- of about half of all Americans. 
> 
> Mr. Kennedy appears more obsessed in chasing conspiracy theories than chasing solutions to lower health care costs for working families in Georgia and to make sure that we are protected. The last thing we need is a dilettante aabbling in conspiracy theories at HHS.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:33:04 WARREN: Since we had our hearing last week, Mr. Kennedy has amended his ethics agreement. 
> 
> Recall that his ethics agreement said that while he was secretary of HHS, he intended to retain a financial interest in ongoing vaccine litigation that he was already collecting money from. 
> 
> And that he wanted to continue to collect that money even though he could affect the outcome of that litigation. 
> 
> Now, he has since changed his position on that. Once this has been exposed and people have talked about it and have some pretty serious reservations about his doing that.
> 
> He has said that he will instead give his financial interest to his son. That is a fig leaf that is so small, it would take a magnifying glass to see it. 
> 
> No one is fooled about what's happening here. 
> 
> Mr. Kennedy refuses to say that he will not participate in these lawsuits financially the day after he leaves office. 
> 
> And yet, Mr. Kennedy has acknowledged first that the American people have a right to know that the decisions you're making are decisions that are in their interest not in your future financial interest. 
> 
> He has said he thinks that's the right standard, and yet he has figured out how to make money off his anti-vax positions. He's already raked in $2.5 million. 
> 
> He is in a position where he can affect the outcomes by things he does as Secretary of HHS. 
> 
> And yet he refuses to say that he will delay by even a day taking on anti-vax lawsuits the minute he leaves. 
> 
> That is an appalling conflict of interest, and it's one in which the American people can reasonably ask, is Mr. Kennedy's plan to help the American people? Or is he planning to use this job to further enrich himself? 
> 
> And he's pointed out with his son, and enrich his family. 
> 
> The importance of this litigation cannot be overstated. This is not only about a private company that gets sued and has to pay out. 
> 
> Vaccine manufacturers often operate on very slim profit margins. If they get sued repeatedly and successfully, they simply move out of the vaccine space. 
> 
> We've already seen this happen with vaccines in the past. 20 years ago, we watched vaccines just move away if they did not have protection from these kinds of lawsuits. 
> 
> The consequence of Mr. Kennedy's ability to make those lawsuits easier is also the ability to shut down access and manufacturing for vaccines for every one of us. And I think that's a terrible mistake.

> HHS continues to increase staff levels as we look forward to the new Secretary leading the agency. HHS has approved numerous communications related to critical health and safety needs and will continue to do so. In addition, ASPA is now more flexible with communications as HHS and its Divisions work to align with President Trump’s agenda.    
> 
> There are several types of external communications that are no longer subject to the pause. All HHS divisions have been given clear guidance on how to seek approval for any other type of mass communication.
