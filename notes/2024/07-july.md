> Alzheimer’s disease is a devastating illness that affects millions of Americans and their families. CMS is committed to helping people get timely access to treatments and improving care for people with Alzheimer’s disease and their families.
> 
> In July 2023, CMS began offering broader Medicare coverage for Leqembi (the brand name for lecanemab) under the National Coverage Decision (NCD) for Monoclonal Antibodies Directed Against Amyloid for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease through the Anti-Aβ mAb Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) Study after the FDA granted traditional approval to the drug for the treatment of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease.
> 
> Under the NCD, to receive Medicare coverage for Leqembi, or any other anti-amyloid mAb that receives traditional approval from the FDA, people need to: 1) be enrolled in Medicare Part B; 2) be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia; and 3) have a physician who participates in a qualifying study with an appropriate clinical team and follow-up care. The CMS National Patient Registry has been established where clinicians participating in the Anti-Aβ mAb CED Study will only need to complete a short, easy-to-use data submission. Individuals with Medicare should speak to their physician about whether this drug is right for them.
> 
> There have been three additional CED studies that have been approved by CMS that would qualify for coverage of anti-amyloid mAbs that have received traditional approval from the FDA. All information regarding these CED studies and the CMS National Patient Registry can be found at: cms.gov/medicare/coverage-evidence-development/monoclonal-antibodies-directed-against-amyloid-treatment-alzheimers-disease-ad.

> Agam Rao, CDC [00:09:59]
> 
> So at this time, vaccine effectiveness is not waning. Serologic studies have shown vaccine titers decrease a few months after vaccination. 
> 
> We know that this has gathered a lot of media attention, but levels of circulating titers are not the only marker of protection. There's other markers of protection, cell mediated immunity, innate immunity, and those things haven't been measured. 
> 
> So the actual clinical significance of waning vaccine titers is really not known. It's typically real world data that helps guide our decisions about policy. 
> 
> And there there has been some analyses that we performed that were published and that has shown that infections after two Jynneos doses in the United States or breakthrough infections, as we call them, are very rare. 
> 
> They've occurred in less than 1% of people who were fully vaccinated, have been associated with less severe infections when they occur and they've occurred at disparate time intervals after vaccination. 
> 
> So, even as recently as a few weeks after the second dose was administered, all the way to several months or even years after vaccination. Next.
> 
> All of this has led to a CDC recommendation that booster doses are not recommended at this time for people who were vaccinated as part of this outbreak. And if you're interested in seeing more information about the data that went into that, and I'd suggest reading the MMWR publication, the reference of which is at the bottom of this slide. Next. 
> 
> So just to reiterate, at this time, the vaccine recommendations for people impacted by the ongoing outbreak are unchanged. 
> 
> People who have recovered from mpox, or people have received the recommended two dose Jynneos series, even if it's been two years since they were vaccinated, do not need any additional mpox vaccinations at this time.
> 
> ...
> 
> Agam Rao, CDC [00:14:00]
> 
> Now, despite this vaccine being available for as long as it has and the interest that was in the vaccine very early on, there hasn't been that much uptake in the vaccine or interest in getting both doses of the vaccine. 
> 
> The data on this slide is through January 9th, 2024. But we believe that it's not too much different at this time. And at that time, only 25% of the people who are recommended to receive two doses of the vaccine had received both doses of the vaccine. 
> 
> We understand from various focus groups that our experts in the division of STD prevention have conducted that some of the reason might be related to not thinking that mpox is in the news.
> 
> But we're hoping that now that this is on the routine immunization schedule and that clinicians know that it is still a problem in the United States, including causing very severe infections, such as that result in death, that there may be more coverage, vaccine coverage for the individuals most at risk.
> 
> ...
> 
> Meghan Pennini, ASPR [00:29:50]
> 
> So I just want to remind everyone for Medicaid and Medicare, because this is within the ACIP recommended immunizations, there is full coverage for all beneficiaries, Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries that fall within the ACIP recommended populations.
> 
> For commercial insurance, so for those who have private insurance, we do expect, and we are hearing, that private insurance plans do intend to fully cover this product, again, likely within the ACIP recommendations. 
> 
> And just a reminder that these private insurance plans are obligated to cover the first plan year that begins one year after the ACIP recommendations. 
> 
> So while they're not fully obligated right now, we are hearing that they do intend to cover, and we are hearing that there is coverage.
> 
> ...
> 
> Meghan Pennini, ASPR [00:30:46]
> 
> So for those who are underinsured or uninsured for under or uninsured individuals, we rely on some of the programs, the immunization programs we rely on for other immunizations, such as the CDC 317 and Vaccine for Children programs, and those will be available. So this vaccine will be available under those programs.
> 
> Of course, for Vaccines for Children, that provides vaccines for uninsured and underinsured when served in certain clinical sites, such as FQHCs and rural health clinics. That of  course in this particular case only applies to 18 year olds, because again of the ACIP recommendation being for 18 years and above.
> 
> For those 19 years and above, the 317 program can be used by jurisdictional partners to serve some of those adults. And we do expect the ordering through those programs to open on or near August 1st of this year. 
> 
> So just a few, in about a month or so. Next. 
> 
> Of course, Ryan White and other HRSA supportive clinics are also important engagement points for the populations that are at risk. And those can also provide access for under and uninsured populations. 
> 
> HRSA grant and Ryan White HIV AIDS program funding may be used to purchase and administer Jynneos vaccine. And there's more information around that, at that link, that HRSA.gov link that's on this slide.
> 
> We'll also mention that there's 340B prime vendor programs that are up and running that can offer reduced price to provider sites.
> 
> ...
> 
> Yon Yu, CDC [00:44:34]
> 
> Resistance has been identified in over 50 patients with mpox, including those who developed treatment emergent resistance to tecovirimat, 11 in tecovirimat naive individuals, and most recently, a new cluster of tecovirimat resistant mpox variant detected in 18 patients from five states.
> 
> ...
> 
> Agam Rao, CDC [00:59:24]
> 
> So at this time there is no recommendation, travel associated recommendation, but the 2022 ACIP recommendations do say that for those who are part of mpox response teams. 
> 
> And by that, we mean someone who might be traveling to DRC as part of Doctors Without Borders, for example, and providing care to patients with mpox, then those individuals should be vaccinated because they don't have access to the PPE that we have here in the United States. 
> 
> As far as people who are working in DRC, it's still a rare disease in most parts of the country. I think there was something in the chat about south Kivu. 
> 
> I mean, the State Department really isn't allowing people to travel to south Kivu for work because it is a conflict region. So I don't think that in the high concentration regions where there is mpox, people would be traveling for work. 
> 
> If there is such a situation that arises for someone who is traveling for other reasons, then please do reach out to at poxvirus at cdc dot gov, and we can handle those situations on a case by case basis. 
> 
> But we're just not a aware of this happening much if, if at all, and want to keep the recommendation as simple as possible at this time.

## CSL Seqirus spokesperson on H5N1 vaccine approval

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** spokesperson for CSL Seqirus
- **Date:** received July 1, 2024

> Checking in to see if there's any comment to share on what regulatory pathway CSL expects to pursue to authorize use of the pre-pandemic H5 vaccine? Do you know how long that process is expected to take?
> 
> - Under the terms of the agreement, CSL Seqirus will fill-finish and deliver approximately 4.8 million doses of pre-pandemic vaccine that is well-matched to the H5 component of the currently circulating strain of H5N1. 
> - CSL Seqirus are in discussions with the FDA regarding the review and approval process. We will work to follow the necessary regulatory pathways for this pre-pandemic vaccine. Due to the confidential nature of these conversations, we’re unable to disclose any additional information.
> - We’d recommend reaching out to BARDA for further information on this matter.
