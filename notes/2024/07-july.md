> Checking in to see if there's any comment to share on what regulatory pathway CSL expects to pursue to authorize use of the pre-pandemic H5 vaccine? Do you know how long that process is expected to take?
> 
> - Under the terms of the agreement, CSL Seqirus will fill-finish and deliver approximately 4.8 million doses of pre-pandemic vaccine that is well-matched to the H5 component of the currently circulating strain of H5N1. 
> - CSL Seqirus are in discussions with the FDA regarding the review and approval process. We will work to follow the necessary regulatory pathways for this pre-pandemic vaccine. Due to the confidential nature of these conversations, we’re unable to disclose any additional information.
> - We’d recommend reaching out to BARDA for further information on this matter.
