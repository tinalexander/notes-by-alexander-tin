- **Date:** received July 18, 2024

> Weld11 housed 1,790,800 chickens, all of which need to be depopulated to meet USDA requirements. 
> 
> We received confirmation from USDA that this strain of HPAI is connected to the genotype circulating in dairy cattle. We don’t yet know how the transmission event occurred. We are requesting epidemiology support from USDA to determine if we can identify the mechanism of transmission
> 
> Yes, the workers who tested positive were responding to the avian flu outbreak at a commercial egg layer operation (Weld11).

## HHS and USDA press briefing on Colorado bird flu outbreak

- **Source:** news conference
- **Attribution:** hosted by the Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture
- **Date:** occurred July 16, 2024

> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:07:45]
> 
> CDC's assessment of the risk to the general population remains low, and CDC has not changed its recommendations. 
> 
> For example, CDC is not recommending H5 specific vaccines for livestock workers given the mild symptoms that have been noted thus far, and the absence of any changes to the virus's genetic makeup that would suggest that the risk to human health is increased. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:09:42]
> 
> Our preliminary analysis of the genetic sequence of the virus recovered from a patient from this poultry farm is reassuring, largely because it does not show concerning changes of the sort that I noted earlier. 
> 
> The sequence is very closely related to two sequences from infected chickens from the farm where the worker was likely exposed. And in addition to that, one of the virus's subunits was 100% identical to the Texas and the first human case from Michigan.
> 
> In addition, our analysis has not revealed any genetic changes to the virus that erode the effectiveness of medicines like Tamiflu. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:10:29]
> 
> Understanding why an outbreak occurs at a particular time and place is a key question in this situation. 
> 
> Environmental factors may have played a role.
> 
> At the time that transmission is thought to have occurred, Colorado was experiencing 104 plus degree heat. 
> 
> Now the barns in which culling operations occur were no doubt even hotter. All of this makes PPE use a challenge. 
> 
> Now there were large scale industrial fans that certainly helped keep the barns cool, but those fans also spread things like feathers around, which are known to carry the virus. 
> 
> In addition, the culling method that was used here entailed workers moving from chicken to chicken, increasing the degree of interaction with each potentially infected bird. 
> 
> This confluence of factors may play a role in explaining why this outbreak occurred, where it did, and when it did.
> 
> Though, I want to stress that our investigation is underway still, but these factors do highlight a pathway for prevention specifically through even more systematic use of PPE, as well as engineering controls to help reduce exposure risk. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:13:24]
> 
> USDA's Animal Plant Health Inspection Service, more commonly called APHIS, can confirm the poultry depopulation operation is in county with dairy herds that have tested positive for H5N1.
> 
> As Nirav mentioned, genomic sequencing of samples from the poultry operation confirms the same type of genotype of HPAI that is in the nearby dairy herds. 
> 
> The raw sequence will be uploaded to NCBI this week and should be available Friday. Publication of polished sequences with complete metadata will take an additional three to four weeks. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:14:10]
> 
> Affected workers have been isolated and poultry depopulation efforts continue in order to stop the virus production and mitigate further spread.
> 
> All decisions regarding this effort are being made while balancing human health and safety and animal health and welfare.
> 
> Right now, USDA considers it very important for depopulation to continue to stop virus amplification and shedding prevent further spread and to reduce the viral load in the environment. 
> 
> If depopulation were to be paused, workers would still be required to care for and feed animals, prolonging their exposure risk for the workers.
> 
> This is critical as depopulating the entire facility, given the ease of transmission of most poultry and the lack of treatment for HPAI in poultry.
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:15:25]
> 
> We anticipate depopulation efforts at this facility will be completed over the next 10 to 14 days. 
> 
> Although as our colleagues from CDC mentioned, this work is ongoing. 
> 
> ...
> 
> David Boucher, ASPR [00:18:26]
> 
> Colorado placed an order for 500 courses of Tamiflu from the SNS this past weekend. Those were overnighted to Colorado and were delivered just before dawn Sunday morning. That concludes the updates. 
> 
> I want to add just a really quick note about numbers. You might hear two numbers, connected to Tamiflu. I want to kind of explain that really quick so that there's no confusion. 
> 
> Colorado ordered 500 courses. Our practice here at the SNS is to avoid shipping partial containers, so things don't bounce around a little too much. 
> 
> So again, just to, to be very crisp on the numbers, the request that we received was for 500 courses, we sent full cartons, so Colorado actually received 528 courses of Tamiflu. 
> 
> ...
> 
> David Boucher, ASPR [00:20:36]
> 
> No changes to those timelines that we reported. 
> 
> We do have, as we said before, a number of pre-filled syringes, and then we're doing fill of additional bulk. We had said that those would-- manufacturing would start to be completed later in July, on course for that, and then completion of all that manufacturing will happen in August. 
> 
> So no changes to that timeline. 
> 
> As we we've said, when we've reported this in the past, though, I do want to kind of just clarify that we're talking about manufacturing timelines to actually use doses. 
> 
> We would need to have a, a reason obviously, but then also a regulatory pathway to do that, some type of regulatory mechanism authorized or approved by the FDA.
> 
> ...
> 
> Julie Gauthier, APHIS [00:26:02]
> 
> We have approximately 160 people working on the farm on the depopulation activities. That includes the producers, employees, contractors, USDA employees, and the people working on depopulation are required to wear Tyvek suits, white paper suits, N95  respirators, goggles, boots and gloves.
> 
> The difficulty with wearing all that gear in that kind of heat, you can imagine. And it was made more difficult by those the fans pushing the air, made it hard to keep those goggles and N95 respirators in place. 
> 
> So the team out there is trying to find other solutions to improve their ability to keep their PPE on their faces.
> 
> ...
> 
> Julie Gauthier, APHIS [00:27:08]
> 
> The method that was chosen to depopulate this barn is CO2 gas using carts. The carts can hold several dozen chickens typically. 
> 
> And so it's a very, very manual, difficult, laborious process to pick up each chicken and place it in the cart. 
> 
> So there's a lot of hands on to do this.
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:30:37]
> 
> There are 1.8 million birds at this facility, which makes it a large layer facility, not the largest one in the country, but a significant facility. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:30:56]
> 
> Our colleagues at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment there, the state public health agency, have been working on contact tracing. 
> 
> Many of the individuals as we've seen in other farms are together at work, but also together outside of work, which makes contact tracing a little bit more feasible, that they've made progress there. 
> 
> And as CDC recommends at the discretion of local health officials, close contacts of confirmed cases are also being offered Tamiflu where appropriate. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:32:23]
> 
> So with respect to this particular poultry farm in Colorado, the uptake of testing has been strong.
> 
> We've tested approximately-- obtained samples from approximately or close to 60 people from the farm who were symptomatic, all of whom were symptomatic. And those specimens have been processed either in Colorado or the ones that were positive in Colorado, that subsection have been sent to the CDC for confirmation. 
> 
> And so we've seen strong uptake of testing across this particular farm in Colorado.
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:41:04]
> 
> The answer is yes, we do believe that we can eliminate this within the dairy herd. 
> 
> And there's a couple of things that we know about this virus from the epidemiological investigation that began in Michigan and has continued throughout. 
> 
> And that includes the fact that there is, as Nirav mentioned, movement with associated with a spread of the disease associated with the movement of cattle, and then within local communities, through the movement of individuals, vehicles and shared equipment. 
> 
> We're not seeing any indications of reintroductions from say wild birds or wild animals. And so we understand that this moves with the cattle and with the people that are closely associated with them. 
> 
> So enhanced biosecurity should get us to a point where we can arrest the spread and hopefully in the future, we may get a vaccine which can further facilitate the elimination of this disease from the national herd.
> 
> But all the signs that we have are, with good biosecurity, with good farmer participation, we will be able to eliminate this.
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:45:45]
> 
> It's imperative that I mention it here, no milk from a sick animal was ever introduced into the human food chain.
> 
> But we do know that cows shed this virus over the course of about 30 days, and they eventually recover. 
> 
> But as they do, there is the potential that it can spread from cow to cow, either on milking equipment or on individuals or other types of shared equipment that are in and around dairy barns. 
> 
> We have seen no indication of respiratory transmission, and when we have studied this in a controlled environment, as part of our efforts to understand the science of this disease and the way in which it can spread, could potentially spread from an animal,  we've seen very, very poor, uh, respiratory transmission in scientific-- and so we have no indication that that's occurring in the field.
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:51:22]
> 
> As part of any typical clinical investigation, in addition to the ongoing public health investigation, we would endeavor to figure out what's going on with them, what virus they have, and this has happened throughout this particular outbreak. 
> 
> Indeed, it happens in just about every respiratory outbreak, more broadly, not speaking of the Colorado case, because I haven't seen the full complement of testing data, but more broadly what we've seen in this outbreak, given the viruses that are circulating at this time of the year right now, when individuals have had a high index of suspicion for H5, but have eventually tested negative, what they've often had is another very commonly circulating respiratory virus like rhinovirus, which has come up quite a bit. 
> 
> Many of those tests would be done at the local clinical level. For example, your regular doctor's office can test for a lot of these common respiratory viruses and those data would not be regularly reported to CDC, but it may be something that local health officials or local conditions may have. 
> 
> But the short answer to your question is, yes, it's not just a simple binary. Do you have H5? And if not, then godspeed.
> 
> This is clinical care in addition to public health care and as a clinical matter, it's important to try to figure out what's going on because there indeed may be other treatments that are available.
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:53:30]
> 
> It's not that mathematical. It's a number of factors that we are weighing on a series of essentially sliding scales. 
> 
> And so the factors in general involve changes to the virus, and changes to the way in which the virus exerts potential human disease. 
> 
> So for example, if we were to see significant changes in the ability of the virus to transmit from person to person, that would go in one direction. 
> 
> Another factor that we keep a close eye on going back to the earlier discussion is the severity of illness that the virus causes indeed because influenza vaccines in particular are really well suited to reduce severe illness, changes that suggest that for example, hospitalization rates were starting to increase because of H5 infection would move us in one direction. 
> 
> I want to stress that, for example, right now, in the cases that we've seen in the recent outbreak, both in bovines, associated with bovines, and associated with poultry, there have been no hospitalizations. 
> 
> And then finally, if we were to see genetic changes to the virus that may suggest a decreased susceptibility to medications like Tamiflu, that would take us in one direction. 
> 
> So as you can see, we're always weighing these factors and discussing how they land.
> 
> I do want to stress that these discussions are ongoing. We talk about this quite a bit. And that's what the American public should expect of a response that's fundamentally one that's rooted in science.
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:56:14]
> 
> USDA is very interested in helping to facilitate the development of a vaccine. 
> 
> And we welcome, both the submissions from the research community, as well as from the commercial marketplace, in helping to develop a vaccine that is effective, that will help us to arrest the spread of this disease within the national herd.
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [01:01:13]
> 
> It was not a hundred percent of people who had respiratory symptoms. About 70. 
> 
> Julie, we'll follow up with you with the exact data, but it was not a hundred percent.
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [01:02:32]
> 
> Not a hundred percent of the individuals in Colorado had respiratory symptoms, not 100% of the individuals in Colorado had eye symptoms, either. 
> 
> It was only about 73% of the individuals in Colorado who had eye symptoms. 
> 
> So not uniformly respiratory, not uniformly eye related.

## BD executive at CDC testing laboratories call

- **Source:** webinar
- **Attribution:** hosted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
- **Date:** occurred July 15, 2024

> Chris Beddard, BD [00:27:38]
> 
> We initially expected this to be temporary in nature, but after working with the vendor and doing some additional investigation analysis, we determined that the issues were more complex, and limit our ability to supply blood culture vials to meet our global demand. 
> 
> We have been working very closely with the supplier and we have actions in place to improve production and output. We anticipate that to support us through the next two months as we move forward through the summer. 
> 
> We've been additionally managing our global supply throughout this challenge via a manual allocation process, improving our distribution transit times, and optimizing our production schedules to meet supplier shipments. 
> 
> We've also discussed, or we've also deployed, a strategy to work with our supplier previously of glass media vials. We're going to  be temporary sourcing the glass bottles for our BD BACTEC Lytic Anaerobic Culture vials. And as soon as we have the clarity on dates, we'll provide another supply update, by the September timeframe. 
> 
> So this is an active, evolving situation. Again, we'll be coming back out to our customers by September of 24. 
> 
> We are looking at this time because we expect to have the confirmed consistency in our output by our vendor, but also have timelines and volumes for glass bottles in the United States, and potentially other markets as we think about the challenges on a global basis.
> 
> I would like to also mention that we've been working very closely with the FDA throughout this challenge, exploring all options to  improve our supply, including providing our supplier with communication to their material vendors, to reinforce the need, the priority prioritization, and the availability of required components to help us with the BACTEC bottle production.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:52:02]
> 
> What is the approximate percentage of blood culture bottles that will be unavailable? So for example, is there a 10% shortage of normal demand, a 50% shortage of normal demand? Any idea on that?
> 
> Chris Beddard, BD [00:52:14]
> 
> It's an evolving situation. We don't have percentages that we are supplying to the market right now. 
> 
> I would suggest that whoever asks that question, maybe directly work with their sales rep and we can have a one-on-one discussion on that. 
> 
> There are no broad communications as it relates to percentages. As I was saying, every week, we're managing this appropriately for what we are able to provide to our customers in the U.S. So there's not a overall percentage that we are stating overall.
> 
> ...
> 
> Chris Beddard, BD [00:53:15]
> 
> Once we have the consistency from our vendor, which with all of the work we're doing, we believe will be shortly in the August timeframe. That's really what our goal is. If not sooner, as soon as we believe that the consistency is there and we have a projection and an outlook, we'll communicate back to our customers.
> 
> The other piece with bringing the Lytic anaerobic media back in glass, we are accelerating that availability for our customers to do validation as required. As soon as I have the dates that I feel I can a hundred percent confirm to our customers, I will bring those out as well. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:54:37]
> 
> Is there any indication that this shortage will expand to other products or is it just unique to this?
> 
> Chris Beddard, BD [00:54:44]
> 
> I can't answer for any other company. All I can say is that this vendor is unique for BD BACTEC vials, the plastic vials. So, there are no other BD products that are impacted from this vendor. So it's unique to the BD BACTEC vial.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:57:52]
> 
> Are there any studies being performed currently around extending expiration dates for the bottles that laboratories already have?
> 
> Chris Beddard, BD [00:58:02]
> 
> So we're working with FDA on certain SKUs to extend the timing. 
> 
> I don't mean to keep asking people to contact their sales rep, but the sales rep would then just would actually forward the questions to my team and myself that we can answer those questions individually for every customer. 
> 
> But we have talked to FDA about the ability to do that so more to come, but it's really based on an individual laboratory and the SKU or media type they have on hand.

## Colorado health department on H5N1 testing of symptomatic workers

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment spokesperson Annemarie Harper
- **Date:** received July 16, 2024

> Yesterday (July 15), the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment distributed post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) antiviral medication to more than 150 workers who had potential exposure to infected poultry at a commercial egg layer operation in Weld County. 
> 
> On Thursday, July 11, CDPHE mobilized a team to test seven symptomatic workers at the facility who had been exposed to infected poultry. On Friday, July 12, a larger team returned to the farm and tested an additional 46 symptomatic workers.
> 
> The testing process is as follows — CDPHE’s State Public Health Laboratory does initial testing and declares presumptive positives, then sends the sample to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There it is re-tested and confirmed as positive. To date, we have had four cases confirmed, and we have one outstanding presumptive positive awaiting CDC confirmation. We are continuing to test symptomatic workers as needed, including 16 symptomatic workers who were tested yesterday. The State Lab will run the samples, per the process described above. 
> 
> All of the workers who had been exposed to infected poultry and were symptomatic reported mild symptoms. They were instructed to isolate and offered Tamiflu. They are currently being monitored. CDPHE continues to follow CDC guidance, which is to test and provide antiviral treatment to anyone who reports symptoms and has recent exposure to infected animals. 
> 
> CDC continues to state that the risk to the general public is low. So far, we have not seen evidence of person-to-person transmission. However, as our response is ongoing, we continue to monitor for genetic variations in the virus and changes in transmission patterns. 
> 
> The State Emergency Operations Center, CDPHE, CDC, USDA, and the Colorado Department of Agriculture are working with the facility to assess use of personal protective equipment. We are working with the facility to come up with sustainable recommendations for their workforce during these summer months.

## CDC spokesperson on Colorado H5N1 cases

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson
- **Date:** received July 15, 2024

> **Attributable to a CDC Spokesperson**
> 
> Four human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) (“H5 bird flu”) virus infection in the state of Colorado have been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This includes all three presumptive-positive cases reported by that state on Friday, July 12 and a fourth specimen that was later found to be presumptive-positive by the state on Friday. CDC also is aware of an additional (fifth) presumptive-positive case in Colorado that will be confirmed at CDC once the specimen arrives. All cases were in farm workers who were involved in the depopulation of poultry at a poultry facility experiencing an outbreak of HPAI H5N1 virus. A CDC team is on the ground in Colorado, supporting their assessment of the poultry outbreak and associated human cases. Given current information, CDC believes that the risk to the public from this outbreak remains low. These cases again underscore the risk of exposure to infected animals. There are no unexpected increases in flu activity otherwise in Colorado, or in other states affected by H5 bird flu outbreaks in cows and poultry. 
> 
> **Background on Cases**
> 
> These workers reported symptoms after being exposed to H5N1 virus-infected poultry. All workers who tested positive reported mild illness. The workers reported conjunctivitis and eye tearing, as well as more typical flu symptoms of fever, chills, coughing and sore throat/runny nose. Additional cases may be reported and subsequently confirmed as monitoring and testing is ongoing. 
> 
> CDC has deployed a multidisciplinary bilingual field team of nine people including epidemiologists, veterinarians, clinicians and an industrial hygienist to Colorado to support their public health response to the outbreak among poultry farm workers. There is ongoing monitoring of workers as part of this assessment and additional specimens are being tested – work that is a continuation of the close partnership between human and animal public health officials at the local, state and Federal levels.
> 
> These are the first cases of H5 virus infection in poultry workers (as opposed to dairy workers) since 2022. The first ever U.S. case of H5 in a poultry worker was reported in Colorado during April 2022.  On July 3, 2024, Colorado also reported a case of H5 in a dairy worker on an affected farm, so that state is experiencing ongoing H5N1 outbreaks on dairy and poultry farms.  
> 
> The designation of the influenza virus neuraminidase (the N in the subtype) is pending influenza genetic sequencing at CDC. Attempts to sequence the virus in the clinical specimens are underway and will be made available within 1-2 days if successful. Additional analysis will look for any genetic changes to the virus that could alter the agency’s risk assessment. 
> 
> CDC’s recommendations related to H5 have not changed at this time. An assessment of these cases will help inform whether this situation warrants a change to the human health risk assessment.
> 
> CDC has more than 170 staff deployed to the agency’s H5N1 Response.  Updates will be provided as information becomes available.

- **Date:** received July 12, 2024

> NMDA examined the claims of suspected HPAI-positive cases at a licensed raw dairy farm in the state. NMDA was only made aware of these claims last week, and we responded as soon as soon as we were made aware.
> 
> We have determined through follow-up with the herd veterinarian, that the livestock at the farm did not have symptoms of HPAI and therefore were not required to be tested during the timeframe that has been in question (early May). The cows were treated for an adverse reaction to a change in feed, which was not considered an illness. No further investigation is ongoing.

> And in 2023 was by far a record year for dengue. And then the bright red bar is what's happening in 2024, so far. 
> 
> And even though we're only halfway through the year, we've surpassed, we almost doubled or more than doubled what happened in 2023, which was the previous record. 
> 
> So you can see from this dengue is getting worse and worse and worse with more than 9.6 million cases already reported in the Americas through June 20th, next slide. 
> 
> And the-- and so now the, in the Caribbean, most of the cases that went in 2024 were in the Southern hemisphere, because that was their summer, but now we're entering summer in the Northern hemisphere and this is what's happening in Puerto Rico. 
> 
> And on this side, you'll see a gray line, which is the average incidence of dengue by week and in the squiggly blue line there near the gray line is what happened last year. And then the darker blue line is what's happening this year. 
> 
> So the same thing that's happening now in the Caribbean happened earlier in the year in South America. And that red line indicates what we call the epidemic threshold. 
> 
> So we're way above the epidemic threshold already. And we haven't even gotten anywhere near peak dengue season in the Caribbean, which generally occurs around September, October. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:10:45]
> 
> So with all of these cases of dengue occurring throughout the tropics in South America, you know that any traveler can bring dengue back into the United States. And we typically see about 1,600 to 1,800 imported dengue cases a year that we actually identify. 
> 
> And this year we've about tripled that number so far. 
> 
> So many more people are coming back with dengue into the continental United States and anywhere under where there is the vector mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus, an imported case can then cause local mosquitoes to get infected. And then cause local cases of transmission of dengue. 
> 
> Fortunately outbreaks of dengue primarily happen in southern Texas, southern Florida, but as indicated on this map, they can happen anywhere. And most recently, occurred in California and in Arizona for the first time ever.
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:11:50]
> 
> So why is dengue going up so much? And there's a variety of factors.
> 
> Back in 2003, the Institute of Medicine developed this convergence model indicated on the right indicating that a variety of social, political, economic factors, genetic factors, physical, environmental factors, and ecological factors combine and interact with humans and microbes to cause these emerging events.
> 
> And many of the topics that they outlined as drivers for disease emergence are now happening with dengue. 
> 
> So for example, with climate and weather, we are experiencing heat waves, like none other right now, and warmer weather promotes viral transmission in mosquitoes. 
> 
> We're also changing ecosystems, but as I mentioned, we're also living in more crowded places and people are more traveling around which for a human mosquito human transmission cycle, if you want to spread dengue, have people move around and that's exactly what's happening.
> 
> Next slide. So, uh, this just illustrates what I've already mentioned previously. There's been a rapid increase in human travel. And so any airline passenger who picks up dengue one place, can go to another place and spread that virus, through mosquitoes that bite that that person.
> 
> Also increasing urban populations, as we mentioned. About more than half the population, now the planet, now lives in urban centers. 
> 
> And since this is a human mosquito human transmission cycle, when you start crowding people together, along with the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which likes to live in crowded urban environments, you have the perfect storm for spreading this virus in populations. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:39:02]
> 
> I think the one thing is that it's clear that the methods that may have worked in the past no longer work. 
> 
> And, I think this resurgence of dengue is a good example. 
> 
> At one point because of yellow fever, people tried to get rid of the Aedes aegypti mosquito in the Western hemisphere, which is an invasive mosquito, and they were actually pretty successful and they got rid of it in many countries around the world with DDT. And, obviously we don't want to use DDT anymore. There's widespread insecticide resistance, for example. 
> 
> So we really need new methods of control that will work in modern environments. And we've had some success with some of these.
> 
> For example, if you infect Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with a bacteria called Wolbachia, which is present in about 40% of all insects, so it's around anyway. And if you spread these mosquitoes with Wolbachia around, it's been shown that, for some reason that nobody really quite understands, when these mosquitoes are infected with Wolbachia, which is a parasite of mosquitoes, basically what happens is these mosquitoes are much less likely to transmit any viral infection, such as dengue, yellow fever, whatever. 
> 
> And so people, when they put these Wolbachia infected mosquitoes out in environments, like in Indonesia, we're doing this in El Salvador now. And in many other countries like Brazil.
> 
> What it shows is that dengue incidence goes way, way down. And so it's a-- and once Wolbachia is in those mosquitoes, it stays there and gets passed on from generation to generation. 
> 
> So once you do it, you can really reduce the rate of dengue. So that's one good example of how a brand new intervention that's environmentally friendly can really reduce incidence of some of many of these viral diseases.

> _Why were testing results inconclusive at the state?_
> 
> Sometimes, a test result comes back borderline or inconclusive because there may not be enough virus in the sample to definitively detect the virus 100% of the time.

> 
> mRNA technology allows for accelerated initial vaccine development and complements current rapid production capabilities. 
> 
> Moderna's mRNA pandemic flu vaccine is currently in early clinical development. The timeline may change, but we anticipate starting phase three trials in 2025. 
> 
> This is a data driven process and requires collaboration with our industry partners and feedback from government partners. 
> 
> I also want to highlight that while the base award will support a vaccine for H5N1, the contract also supports development and procurement of a vaccine targeting new strains of influenza or other emerging infectious diseases.

> This approach enables flexibility to pivot to new threats in the ever changing global public health threat landscape. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:16:52]
> 
> Most importantly, we want to continue to reiterate in this forum and in every forum, just how critical enhanced biosecurity is to containing this virus and present preventing its spread among the nation's dairy herds.
> 
> Producers, whether their herds are affected or not, must take extra precautions to limit people coming on and off their farms take appropriate steps to clean and disect equipment, and clothing, and do all that they can in order to enhance biosecurity to limit the spread of this disease. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:23:41]
> 
> I'll start with an update on our current capacity for influenza testing in the United States.
> 
> Reassuringly, we have an ample number of H5 specific tests in the public health system for the current outbreak. 
> 
> As of right now, there are roughly 750,000 H5 specific tests available today. And another 1.2 million such tests coming online in the next two to three months. 
> 
> This is on top of a robust supply of influenza A test, the general tests, that are available at doctor's offices around the country.
> 
> Those influenza A tests, the more general tests, are the first tier in the approach to testing. And those influenza A tests are plentiful and widely available.
> 
> ...

> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Johnson, BARDA [00:34:34] 
>  
> So at this point, it's too early to tell. We need to see the data around what the dosing will look like, and that's true, both for pandemic influenza, as well as for any emerging infectious disease where the ability to manufacture be really be dependent upon the data that we're waiting to see later this year.
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:38:51]
> 
> We do know that the vast majority of farms practice biosecurity, and that includes dairy farms, practice biosecurity.
> 
> But this is a new and emerging disease that calls for a different set of biosecurity practices or enhancements of specific ones. 
> 
> So many dairies are already using what's called the FARM program, and that is a baseline biosecurity, and we're making recommendations that folks go beyond that and supporting them financially so that they can do so.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Johnson, BARDA [00:39:43]
> 
> So this, the shelf life, will actually be data driven. It hasn't been determined yet. 
> 
> And ultimately that will be an FDA decision on what type of shelf life to get that. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:40:04]
> 
> This is all under discussion right now. We are, as we always are as a scientifically driven set of organizations, always evaluating pros and cons of risks, benefits, upside and downside of any potential measure, including vaccination for farm workers.
> 
> In this situation, we're looking at partly the risk, but really, in addition to that, factors like what might demand be based on what the perception of severity is, and then also what what are we intending to vaccinate against?
> 
> Vaccines tend to be better at preventing severe disease, rather than transmission. If our goal here is to prevent transmission, for example, which is certainly one of our goals among humans, we're also analyzing whether there might be intermediate measures, for example, more widespread distribution of antivirals that may achieve that goal even more quickly. 
> 
> So it's not so much strictly what the downsides are, but it's also a question of what the potential uptake might be, as well as what the goal of the overall effort is.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:46:40]
> 
> Is there any talk about doing a financial assistance program for workers who may need to take leave if they are sick, or if they do test positive?
> 
> I know that's a concern with $75 a day, for getting the test is one thing, but what if they test positive? Is there additional assistance for them? 
> 
> And relatedly, is there talk of a campaign for seasonal flu vaccines this fall thinking about reassortment and other concerns like that? Thank you so much.
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:47:11]
> 
> I will start with the latter of your questions. 
> 
> I referenced earlier that I've been having meetings with state health officials, epidemiologists, and state health directors to talk about near term, medium term, and long term planning. 
> 
> And both of the items that you discussed have been on the agenda for some of those meetings, we've talked about them with those groups, and we've talked about that internally as well. 
> 
> Again, we, we try to talk about everything that's a viable option, even if it's something that we're not able to actually do.
> 
> More to come certainly on the seasonal piece, because we acknowledge that there is both something that's -- it's important for a group of workers who may not have the steadiest access to healthcare to have a dedicated channel through which to obtain essential healthcare like seasonal flu shots. 
> 
> We also recognize that there's a-- they are in a particular place in the animal human interface, and may be coinfected, and that there may be epidemiological consequences. 
> 
> So, more to come, but that's been under active discussion.
> 
> Likewise, with respect to something akin to sick leave, no final decisions on either of those yet, but other than active discussions around both.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dawn O'Connell, ASPR [00:49:48]
> 
> They've got 4.8 million in bulk that they have begun fill finishing. And our expectation is that those first doses begin coming off the line in the middle of this month. 
> 
> Every indication is that timeline continues to hold, and we will begin seeing the doses middle of July continuing to roll off through August, which is very efficient from the perspective of our planning. 
> 
> It was faster than we had initially anticipated. So we're really pleased that that timeline continues to hold. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:51:21]
> 
> We, along with our partners both across the USG, but also with our colleagues, such as those on ACIP, we're thinking about sort of, as I noted with Alex's question, what the goal of vaccination might be, first and foremost, for farm worker health.
> 
> To reiterate for everyone, the risk that the general population right now remains low and CDC's assessment of that has not changed. 
> 
> But with respect to livestock worker vaccination, if our goal is to reduce the number of infections that may occur, we have to wonder whether vaccination is the best route for that, or whether there may be other routes that are faster or even more effective such as, as I mentioned, more widespread use of antivirals. 
> 
> So question number one is what is the goal we are aiming toward there and is vaccination the right tool to get us toward that goal. 
> 
> And then if so, then we engage in more of a discussion about the benefits, as well as what the uptake might be. 
> 
> If right now, H5 is not perceived as a pressing threat among farm workers, and I'm not speculating as to whether it is or not, but if that is the case, then uptake may not be robust.
> 
> Rather other mechanisms, again, may be better suited to achieve the goal that we want there. So that's the evaluation that's underway. 
> 
> As has been said before, no final decisions are made, but we are in the process of robust discussion, as we should be for any scientifically driven venture. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:55:36]
> 
> Today, we are not aware of any cases of H5 among humans in the area, nor are we aware of any markers of cases among humans, emergency department visits, reports from clinicians, any of those systems that we normally query to an understand what may be happening, none of those has signaled a possibility of H5 infection among humans. 
> 
> And so if it's not among humans, what might it be? And we are investigating different hypotheses. 
> 
> The San Francisco metropolitan area is not known for its dairy industry. So that's not high on our list of hypotheses. 
> 
> What is higher on the list is at least one or two live bird markets. Again, I want to stress, this is a hypothesis that is under investigation, but rather than the conclusion, we are working with the San Francisco Department of Public Health, as well as the California Department of Public Health, to better understand whether the timing of those bird markets and the subsequent cleaning of those markets aligns with the wastewater samples.
> 
> No conclusions as of yet. We are investigating, however.

## CMS spokesperson on coverage of donanemab if approved

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokesperson
- **Date:** received July 1, 2024

> Alzheimer’s disease is a devastating illness that affects millions of Americans and their families. CMS is committed to helping people get timely access to treatments and improving care for people with Alzheimer’s disease and their families.
> 
> In July 2023, CMS began offering broader Medicare coverage for Leqembi (the brand name for lecanemab) under the National Coverage Decision (NCD) for Monoclonal Antibodies Directed Against Amyloid for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease through the Anti-Aβ mAb Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) Study after the FDA granted traditional approval to the drug for the treatment of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease.
> 
> Under the NCD, to receive Medicare coverage for Leqembi, or any other anti-amyloid mAb that receives traditional approval from the FDA, people need to: 1) be enrolled in Medicare Part B; 2) be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia; and 3) have a physician who participates in a qualifying study with an appropriate clinical team and follow-up care. The CMS National Patient Registry has been established where clinicians participating in the Anti-Aβ mAb CED Study will only need to complete a short, easy-to-use data submission. Individuals with Medicare should speak to their physician about whether this drug is right for them.
> 
> There have been three additional CED studies that have been approved by CMS that would qualify for coverage of anti-amyloid mAbs that have received traditional approval from the FDA. All information regarding these CED studies and the CMS National Patient Registry can be found at: cms.gov/medicare/coverage-evidence-development/monoclonal-antibodies-directed-against-amyloid-treatment-alzheimers-disease-ad.

> Agam Rao, CDC [00:09:59]
> 
> So at this time, vaccine effectiveness is not waning. Serologic studies have shown vaccine titers decrease a few months after vaccination. 
> 
> We know that this has gathered a lot of media attention, but levels of circulating titers are not the only marker of protection. There's other markers of protection, cell mediated immunity, innate immunity, and those things haven't been measured. 
> 
> So the actual clinical significance of waning vaccine titers is really not known. It's typically real world data that helps guide our decisions about policy. 
> 
> And there there has been some analyses that we performed that were published and that has shown that infections after two Jynneos doses in the United States or breakthrough infections, as we call them, are very rare. 
> 
> They've occurred in less than 1% of people who were fully vaccinated, have been associated with less severe infections when they occur and they've occurred at disparate time intervals after vaccination. 
> 
> So, even as recently as a few weeks after the second dose was administered, all the way to several months or even years after vaccination. Next.
> 
> All of this has led to a CDC recommendation that booster doses are not recommended at this time for people who were vaccinated as part of this outbreak. And if you're interested in seeing more information about the data that went into that, and I'd suggest reading the MMWR publication, the reference of which is at the bottom of this slide. Next. 
> 
> So just to reiterate, at this time, the vaccine recommendations for people impacted by the ongoing outbreak are unchanged. 
> 
> People who have recovered from mpox, or people have received the recommended two dose Jynneos series, even if it's been two years since they were vaccinated, do not need any additional mpox vaccinations at this time.
> 
> ...
> 
> Agam Rao, CDC [00:14:00]
> 
> Now, despite this vaccine being available for as long as it has and the interest that was in the vaccine very early on, there hasn't been that much uptake in the vaccine or interest in getting both doses of the vaccine. 
> 
> The data on this slide is through January 9th, 2024. But we believe that it's not too much different at this time. And at that time, only 25% of the people who are recommended to receive two doses of the vaccine had received both doses of the vaccine. 
> 
> We understand from various focus groups that our experts in the division of STD prevention have conducted that some of the reason might be related to not thinking that mpox is in the news.
> 
> But we're hoping that now that this is on the routine immunization schedule and that clinicians know that it is still a problem in the United States, including causing very severe infections, such as that result in death, that there may be more coverage, vaccine coverage for the individuals most at risk.
> 
> ...
> 
> Meghan Pennini, ASPR [00:29:50]
> 
> So I just want to remind everyone for Medicaid and Medicare, because this is within the ACIP recommended immunizations, there is full coverage for all beneficiaries, Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries that fall within the ACIP recommended populations.
> 
> For commercial insurance, so for those who have private insurance, we do expect, and we are hearing, that private insurance plans do intend to fully cover this product, again, likely within the ACIP recommendations. 
> 
> And just a reminder that these private insurance plans are obligated to cover the first plan year that begins one year after the ACIP recommendations. 
> 
> So while they're not fully obligated right now, we are hearing that they do intend to cover, and we are hearing that there is coverage.
> 
> ...
> 
> Meghan Pennini, ASPR [00:30:46]
> 
> So for those who are underinsured or uninsured for under or uninsured individuals, we rely on some of the programs, the immunization programs we rely on for other immunizations, such as the CDC 317 and Vaccine for Children programs, and those will be available. So this vaccine will be available under those programs.
> 
> Of course, for Vaccines for Children, that provides vaccines for uninsured and underinsured when served in certain clinical sites, such as FQHCs and rural health clinics. That of  course in this particular case only applies to 18 year olds, because again of the ACIP recommendation being for 18 years and above.
> 
> For those 19 years and above, the 317 program can be used by jurisdictional partners to serve some of those adults. And we do expect the ordering through those programs to open on or near August 1st of this year. 
> 
> So just a few, in about a month or so. Next. 
> 
> Of course, Ryan White and other HRSA supportive clinics are also important engagement points for the populations that are at risk. And those can also provide access for under and uninsured populations. 
> 
> HRSA grant and Ryan White HIV AIDS program funding may be used to purchase and administer Jynneos vaccine. And there's more information around that, at that link, that HRSA.gov link that's on this slide.
> 
> We'll also mention that there's 340B prime vendor programs that are up and running that can offer reduced price to provider sites.
> 
> ...
> 
> Yon Yu, CDC [00:44:34]
> 
> Resistance has been identified in over 50 patients with mpox, including those who developed treatment emergent resistance to tecovirimat, 11 in tecovirimat naive individuals, and most recently, a new cluster of tecovirimat resistant mpox variant detected in 18 patients from five states.
> 
> ...
> 
> Agam Rao, CDC [00:59:24]
> 
> So at this time there is no recommendation, travel associated recommendation, but the 2022 ACIP recommendations do say that for those who are part of mpox response teams. 
> 
> And by that, we mean someone who might be traveling to DRC as part of Doctors Without Borders, for example, and providing care to patients with mpox, then those individuals should be vaccinated because they don't have access to the PPE that we have here in the United States. 
> 
> As far as people who are working in DRC, it's still a rare disease in most parts of the country. I think there was something in the chat about south Kivu. 
> 
> I mean, the State Department really isn't allowing people to travel to south Kivu for work because it is a conflict region. So I don't think that in the high concentration regions where there is mpox, people would be traveling for work. 
> 
> If there is such a situation that arises for someone who is traveling for other reasons, then please do reach out to at poxvirus at cdc dot gov, and we can handle those situations on a case by case basis. 
> 
> But we're just not a aware of this happening much if, if at all, and want to keep the recommendation as simple as possible at this time.
