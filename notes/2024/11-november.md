> Robert Califf, FDA [00:10:47]
> 
> Personally I'm disappointed in the election, and it's not about me because, I think it's pretty well known, I had not planned on coming back to FDA until I got a call asking me to come back. I was having a pretty good life in Alphabet land. And, so I came back and I feel like from the FDA perspective, we are sort of got all engines on go right now, we've done a massive reorganization. We've got very significant plans. There's a meeting going on today that I just left going over the hiring, we're hiring pretty well and not having trouble getting very talented people. 
> 
> And I think, we just don't know what's going to happen now. So it's not correct of me to make any specific comments about exactly what will happen, but I do think it's pretty clear that the gist of this administration from everything that's been said is to change a lot of things and how it gets changed depends on who gets appointed into key positions and how the various policies play out. 
> 
> And I also think how the broader, as FDA is concerned, how the broader regulated industries see things and play into this. 
> 
> So, in times of changing chaos, there's also opportunity. And, I will just comment, there are a lot of things that I'll bet almost everyone in leadership positions in the health agencies would've liked to have changed, but couldn't because of the sort of gridlock of various interests that made it difficult to change things. 
> 
> So, I think this obviously I'm biased, but I feel like the FDA is sort of at peak performance right now. And, we'll just see what happens as a new team comes in.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:13:10]
> 
> I'm curious how you respond to the kinds of threats that have been made by people like RFK Jr. saying very specifically that he wants to clear out FDA groups that work in certain categories like nutrition and who knows what else? 
> 
> Because from the outside, we see that and we're like, oh my God, I can't believe he just said that. But you at the agency, how do you guys take that kind of threat? How do you respond to something like that? Well, that's out there, it's going viral. It's being-- it's all over the place.
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:13:36]
> 
> In my role, it's best not to respond to those kinds of things, because what-- getting into a back and forth about hypotheticals is not productive for anyone. 
> 
> I will say, I was, I'm not an expert on food. And my first term, Steve Ostroff had been the acting commissioner and he did have food expertise and he became the deputy commissioner when I came in and handled most of that. 
> 
> So this time around though, it's been, the majority of my time, for example, has been on food. And, I don't think you have to be too smart to say, we have a chronic disease crisis going on in this country that starts in childhood with terrible diets that are not getting better. And, there is work that needs to be done.
> 
> But I still love Alastair Woods's old article in the New England Journal, kick the FDA, America's favorite sport.
> 
> The things that go on with the American diet, they're the people who work in the nutrition of FDA-- I've gotten to know them pretty well. They are really hard working people and they're limited in what they can change by the laws that Congress passes. 
> 
> And, so, I don't want to get into a back and forth about it. I would just say, I want to stand by the people who work at FDA. 
> 
> They're good people, there's hardworking, and they want what's best for the American public. I have no question about that.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:15:17]
> 
> Do you foresee any kind of mass exodus or change at the agency at the sort of the staff, the drug reviewer level, based on the what's happened in the election?
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:15:27]
> 
> I think people are waiting to see, and from things that have been said, the change could happen internally or for external decisions made by the administration. 
> 
> So I just think we have to wait and see and have some faith that hardworking high quality people are going to still be in place and will have support, I hope from the external regulated community, which given the dynamics is likely to be the most important factor. 
> 
> I don't think that there's a lot that people inside of FDA can say. 
> 
> And you know, what I've seen already is that they're putting their heads down and doing their work.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:19:07]
> 
> First of all, it is very clear, that there is a hierarchy of-- it's an executive branch. 
> 
> So you got a commissioner, and you've got an HHS secretary and you got a president. And the tradition in 99.95% of FDA decisions about individual products, is that those decisions are made by career civil servants. 
> 
> The commissioner actually has no role in that, unless there's an internal dissent and an appeal, or in some cases, an external appeal that makes it all the way up to the commissioner level, but it's totally within the law for the president or the HHS secretary to overrule the entire FDA. 
> 
> And, so that could happen. Did it happen to me? No. But I also want to say, I think the view that there's a sharp line between political and scientific, we got to speak truthfully about this. It's not a sharp line in many cases.
> 
> I feel like for individual product decisions where you have high quality evidence, where the criteria is based on survive, feel, or function, the sort of standard criteria for medical products, there is no role for politics there. If a drug enables people to live longer and the benefit risk equation is positive by law, the FDA should approve it.
> 
> But there's so many other aspects of this that are integrated in various ways with politics. And there's just no way around it. 
> 
> I have a whole series of essays I'm going to write when I finish. I'm up to over 90, but three of them are on something called OIRA, which I've been asking as I go around to public health schools and other places I've been doing lately because of H5N1, no one knows what OIRA is. 
> 
> But as I think, you know, if FDA wants to put out a rule, which is interpreting a law, basically that Congress has passed in a way that has a huge impact on what happens, it cannot get through without OIRA letting it through. And that's a political arm of the White House. 
> 
> So, to argue that there's no integration of politics and science, I think is a mistake, and we're going to need to talk bluntly about this, I predict, as we go through the next phase.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:32:11]
> 
> Well, I think in the ideal-- you know, I'm an observer of this, I've never been a center director. I've never been a staff. I was a deputy commissioner for a while, so I'm just an observer.
> 
> But this is part of what I mentioned with executive function. In the ideal world, as I said, that uncertainty is being reduced. I think the most underappreciated part of the FDA is all those meetings that occur before the final application goes in. 
> 
> And during the course of those meetings, if there's a controversy in the ideal circumstance, the staff and the leadership of the center would be in conversations to resolve those issues. So overruling would be unnecessary. 
> 
> So in the ideal world, you should never have to overrule your staff, but we don't live in an ideal world and we have personalities in the FDA and we also have a situation in a way it was sort of the good old days when I was on the cardiorenal panel, there was one FDA opinion. 
> 
> Now it was opaque what all the different sub opinions were within that. Now, everyone can express their opinion in writing. And so that leads to a much more give and take between the center director and the staff. 
> 
> So-- but I think a goal of any center director would be to make it so that was, the goal should be sort of like ventilator acquired pneumonia, zero should be the goal, realizing in the real world, you can't quite achieve that.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:33:47]
> 
> Do you have two or three priorities that you you have set on or what are sort of the few things that you wanna get accomplished in the time you have left at the agency?
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:33:56]
> 
> Well, I feel like the medical products are on the way and there's some very significant, relatively technical things that need to get done. 
> 
> The big deal for the public health is tobacco and food. And we have major things there that we're hoping to get done. 
> 
> It's publicly known, the menthol rule has been an issue, and we also have a very good understanding of what the addictive level of nicotine is. So the nicotine standard would be the biggest deal. 
> 
> We can't enforce a nicotine standard, but we could possibly put out a proposed rule that would unveil to the public what's at stake in terms of public health. 
> 
> And then for food, it's just simple stuff. Like, how can it be that you can't get the label on the front of the package? That just sounds crazy to me, but it's a ordeal. 
> 
> Many in the industry are opposed to it, and we're trying to update the term healthy so that when you put, let's face it, most people are busy when they go shopping. They don't study the label and take 10 minutes for every decision. They react to what's in front of them. 
> 
> So if we could just label things that are basically healthy as healthy, that would make a big difference. Those are the very, most important things. 
> 
> I don't wanna belittle the medical product side, but the changes there are technical and very important to the elements that are involved, but food and tobacco that's what's causing the chronic and serious crisis we're having right now in our life expectancy.
