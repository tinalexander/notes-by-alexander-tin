## CDC testing official on clade I mpox preparedness

> Christina Hutson, CDC [00:16:44]
> 
> In 2023, we saw a dramatic increase in the number of suspect cases. There were over 14,000 suspect cases and 660 deaths. 
> 
> And then in 2024, this number needs to be updated, but we've already seen over 1,000 cases with 101 deaths. 
> 
> This is seen in 23 out of 26 provinces, as you can see in the picture on the right. So almost the entire country of DRC is reporting suspect mpox cases. And I say suspect because most of them have not been tested by laboratory tests. 
> 
> They're only being called mpox based on the clinical presentation. And this is because DRC has very limited testing that is occurring. During 2023, only around 9% of all cases were tested. 
> 
> The other concerning flags we saw in 2023 is that there were cases in urban settings where we typically haven't seen mpox. And then also cases along borders, really raising some concerns about spread to other countries. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Christina Hutson, CDC [00:17:52]
> 
> So the transmission in DRC is quite different from what we see in the U.S. and also different from what we've historically seen in the DRC. And really the main, demographic group that is being infected in the DRC seems to be in children. And that's also where most deaths are occurring and this is less than 15 years. 
> 
> So that is actually what we historically have seen, but we've also seen transmission due to sexual contacts and sex trade workers, primarily these are women's sex trade workers. So not exactly the same outbreak setting that we saw start in 2022. But concerning again, because we haven't seen sexual transmission of displayed in the past. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Christina Hutson, CDC [00:18:40]
> 
> So I mentioned that only 9% of the, the specimens have been tested. 
> 
> And then we have seen some sequence data come out of the DRC that does continue to support that there are zoonotic introductions of this virus and not necessarily sustained human to human transmission occurring, but we are lacking a lot of information. 
> 
> This is a very limited number of assessments that are being sequenced. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Christina Hutson, CDC [00:19:18]
> 
> So going into the U.S. preparedness in case we do have a case of clade I, next slide. 
> 
> So today there are still, thankfully, no cases of clade I mpox detected in the United States or anywhere outside of endemic countries within Africa. 
> 
> However, we are raising awareness about these concerning flags that I mentioned, with these outbreaks in the DRC. And so to do this, we did issue a HAN in December where we're encouraging clade specific testing in DRC travelers, we're encouraging vaccination because right now only one and four of eligible individuals within the U.S. have received a Jynneos vaccine, and then messaging that prevention, both vaccination and treatment, are expected to perform similarly for clade I, as we've seen for clade II.
> 
> We also put out a travel health notice alerting about the outbreak in the DRC and increasing our clinical outreach. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Christina Hutson, CDC [00:25:45]
> 
> There's no commercial labs that we're aware of offering clade I testing, but as I mentioned there, Quest is one commercial lab that offers a multiplex that looks for clade II and orthopox generic target. 
> 
> So we can use that if you have an orthopox positive clade II negative, that should be treated as high suspicion for clade I. 
> 
> It could be a mutation, but we definitely want to do additional testing to confirm. So although it's not specifically clade I testing, it very much helps us under those surveillance efforts to see if we have any clade I circulating.

> Jim Jones, FDA [00:03:03]
> 
> This summer, we plan to issue a proposed rule on FOP labeling. 
> 
> The proposed rule would be based on extensive research and stakeholder input.
> 
> Front of package labeling has the potential to be a very useful tool to provide information for busy consumers, especially those with lower nutrition knowledge, to make nutritious food selections more easily when grocery shopping.
> 
> We completed a literature review, two rounds of focus groups and an experimental study to help us choose a label to propose.
> 
> The research so far has told us consumers prefer simple interpretive FOP labeling schemes. 
> 
> The Reagan Udall Foundation public meeting in November provided us with an important opportunity to hear from a variety of stakeholders and the general public. 
> 
> We heard at the public meeting that there's wide interest in FOP labeling across sectors of society, industry, healthcare, consumer public health groups, and academia. And we are carefully considering the input we've received as well as lessons from international experiences. 
> 
> If implemented, FOP labeling would complement the nutrition facts label and work with other labeling efforts to provide information to help consumers more easily make nutritious food choices. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Jim Jones, FDA [00:10:25]
> 
> I can tell you that on our website, you can go and see the labels that we tested. 
> 
> I can't tell you which one we are going to propose, but you can get a general sense of them. 
> 
> I will say that what we learned in our testing, and the one that we selected, is the one that consumers best understood, and would therefore be able to make an informed choice. 
> 
> And so we really went with what did people say, where we were trying to convey a specific message, they understood that message, so they'd be empowered to make a healthier choice. 
> 
> So it-- our label will line up with what consumers say they understood the best.
> 
> ...
> 
> Jim Jones, FDA [00:11:34]
> 
> Historically, manufacturers have been able to use the term as they have chosen, as long as they met the standard. Some of them just incorporate it into the name of the product. 
> 
> We believe that it would be help-- more helpful for consumers if we were to come up with a label or a logo, so that a manufacturer could actually put on a logo, and so you could recognize it across products. 
> 
> They wouldn't have to use it, but our experience is that they probably would. 
> 
> So after we finalize the rule, we're going to be working with manufacturers and consumers to develop a logo that a manufacturer could then put on a product that was qualified, which would make it easier for consumer to understand that that product has been evaluated against a criteria and it meets the criteria for healthy. 
> 
> So this will be some of a two step process, first create the standard and then come up with a logo or a label that could be used by manufacturers that meet the standard.
> 
> Question [00:12:39]
> 
> I guess, next months a year? Is that-- is there a timeframe?
> 
> Jim Jones, FDA [00:12:45]
> 
> No, I believe we will be able to finalize the standard itself this spring. 
> 
> I think the logo development will follow anywhere 6 to 12 months later.
> 
> The creation of the logo doesn't require regulation. It really is about-- it's kind of-- it's almost like a-- working with consumers and manufacturers about what logo would best communicate this and be easily recognizable. 
> 
> And it's more of a marketing activity as opposed to regulatory.
> 
> ...
> 
> Jim Jones, FDA [00:24:44]
> 
> So the original, there is already a regulation on the books, it was established in the 90s, that set criteria for saying food is healthy. 
> 
> We are basically updating it to reflect current science. 
> 
> So then there are about 3%, rather small percent, 3% of manufactured foods are eligible for it. As I said, some of them just use-- they use it in their name. And so you could-- I don't wanna like call out any particular product, as opposed to saying this meets FDA's criteria for healthy.
> 
> We think that we could really sort of energize the program, the use of this, by actually coming up with a logo. 
> 
> But the other thing I do want to say is that all fresh fruits and vegetables are, and will be, eligible for the claim. It really is sort of a way to motivate manufactured products and a relatively small percentage of manufactured products meet the current definition. 
> 
> That will probably change marginally when we update the definition. It's really an updating of an existing standard. 
> 
> The part to me that's actually is exciting is coming up with a logo that could then be used for marketing purposes for products that meet the standard. 
> 
> Because right now, as I said, it's sort of, as a company you can use sort of what language you want as long as you are eligible.
> 
> ...
> 
> Jim Jones, FDA [00:29:13]
> 
> So we've been in the manufacturer of the Wanabana product, the Austrofoods food plant. We've been there for an inspection. 
> 
> And essentially the spice producer who sold to Austrofoods is where we don't have authority, but I think that we've actually done a good job, we have prevented them from bringing anything into this country. 
> 
> We know who their customers are. We know-- we have import alerts for any of those products and actually they now don't have any customers.
> 
> By naming them, we in effect we're-- had let the world know to be-- to have your eyes wide open about this supplier. 
> 
> So although we can't go, we can't like prosecute the cinnamon seller to Austrofoods, I think we've been effective at doing what we want to do, which is to keep their product out of the country. 
> 
> We have that-- we have asked-- it's unrelated to specifically your question, but the authority that we asked for about a year ago from Congress is to give us authority to require testing of heavy metals in children's products, which would've been a useful tool to have had in place a year ago. 
> 
> But I think that the authority related to this company is I don't think totally the issue. I think the issue is do we have the authority to keep their products out of this country? And I think we do.
> 
> ...
> 
> Jim Jones, FDA [00:39:50]
> 
> At the point of sale, consumers are making decisions in a nanosecond and, and a nanosecond doesn't really allow for that turning the bottle around, turning the packaging around and spending time, trying to ascertain, what is this telling me? 
> 
> There is-- there are consumers who are doing that and of that we are appreciative, that they do that. 
> 
> But what we have learned from consumer research is that at point of sales, it is a snap judgment, and you've gotta be able to give people information in a snap, that they can process in seconds. 
> 
> And we think that there is a fair amount of evidence from other countries and from the testing, we've done similar testing, literally testing how long it took people to understand a mock label. 
> 
> And so this is a little bit different. It's giving information, but information in a way that we have evidence that people are able to process in the way in which they are making decisions at the point of sale.

> 
> The mpox outbreak that started in May 2022 is still ongoing as of February 2024, but has waned in terms of case numbers per day in terms of domestic cases, however, caseloads in Sub-Saharan Africa remain an issue and the Democratic Republic of Congo is experiencing a significant increase in cases of clade I mpox. 
> 
> As a part of our smallpox preparedness, BARDA is increasing its supply of the U.S. stored inventory of Jynneos, the smallpox and mpox vaccine. The vaccine continues to be made available to jurisdictions for the ongoing mpox response. 
> 
> BARDA continues its partnerships to develop better and more rapidly produced pandemic influenza vaccines that shorten pandemic influenza response timelines, and increase vaccine accessibility to ensure the nation is prepared to respond to the next influenza pandemic.
> 
> Protocol development for a BARDA sponsored randomized double blind phase two clinical trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of egg based H5N8 influenza vaccine at different antigen dose levels, and adjuvanted with ASO3 and MF59 continues. Study start is projected for summer of 2024. 
> 
> And finally, under Project Next Gen, BARDA in partnership with Luminary Labs will launch two prize competitions that will provide prize based awards to partners that will one focus on the formulation of RNA based vaccines on microneedle patches, and two, accelerate the development of single dose vaccines that can support a rapid pandemic response.

## HHS advisory committee session on school immunization policies

- **Source:** hosted by the Department of Health and Human Services
- **Attribution:** meeting of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee
- **Date:** occurred February 22, 2024

> Darlene Huang Briggs, Network for Public Health Law [00:02:54]
> 
> During the pandemic, we came together to track and address the various attacks in state legislatures and courts across the country against the various uses of public health authority, especially emergency authority to mitigate the rapid COVID 19 next slide please. 
> 
> So the network in partnership with the National Association of County and City Health Officials documented the coordinated backlash against public health authority in state legislatures. In these early reports, we saw efforts to outright prohibit or shift or limit fundamental public health powers, and more generally to upset the balance of those powers for the collective good with individual liberties. 
> 
> These efforts happened across the country and were successful in rolling back public health powers in over half of states, think things like bans on employer vaccination requirements or mask mandates, as well as blocking the use of business closures or quarantine and shifting power from the executive branch to the legislature for decisions that require public health expertise. 
> 
> And it will come is no surprise to all of you, but the very clear through line Act for Public Health saw in all of these efforts to undermine public health expertise was that vaccines continue to be a target and a bellweather for navigating changes to public health authority more generally. So next slide, please. 
> 
> Last year we narrowed our legislative tracking focus to a subset of vaccine bills. And what you're seeing here is that data set from our friends at Temple University's Center for Public Health Law Research. They have systematically coded and visually mapped school vaccine and provider scope of practice bills identified by the Association for State and Territorial Health Officials from January to May of last year. They're currently working on an update through the end of 2023. And so what have they found? Next slide please.
> 
> Out of 196 total bills introduced, which sought to change existing school entry requirements and the availability of non-medical exemptions and to revisit who determines which vaccines are required for school entry, only 11 of those bills were ultimately ended.
> 
> Most expanded scope practice for additional healthcare providers to administer vaccines and just three prohibited various school entry vaccination requirements. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Darlene Huang Briggs, Network for Public Health Law [00:07:16]
> 
> There are a number of more recent troubling trends to the use of public health authority and for vaccine mandates specifically. The free exercise clause of the first amendment is at the center of these legal challenges. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Georgina Peacock, CDC [00:19:38]
> 
> So at the state and local level, enforcing school immunization requirements is really a key strategy to encouraging vaccination catch up and school immunization requirements were enacted and enforced in 1977 and really were a driving force behind high immunization rates in schools before the COVID 19 pandemic. 
> 
> These requirements have played a significant role in measles being declared eliminated in 2000. And obviously what we're seeing today, in the media and in different places, does raise some concerns. 
> 
> But we know that when MMR vaccination coverage drops below 95%, communities are at risk for outbreaks.

## HHS advisory committee session on immunization shortages

- **Attribution:** meeting of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee
- **Date:** occurred February 22, 2024

> Joe Figlio, ASPR [00:14:40]
> 
> The demand and supply is stabilizing, right? The COVID cliff has happened and things have dropped off considerably. 
> 
> However, as soon as this week, as recent as this week, we had an issue with, and it's still continuing, things like electrical switch gear. So other other components used to build new facilities, the biggest lead time item now is electrical switch gear and other electrical components. 
> 
> So that is still one of the top lingering issues in the supply chain that we see.
> 
> ...
> 
> Tonya Villafana, AstraZeneca [00:31:25]
> 
> The novel approach required years of prep to ensure that we had scale, that we could meet the scale, and that we would have broad deployment of the antibody.
> 
> Manufacturing an antibody can take up to 12 months to complete, with numerous steps, including creation of the drug substance, so where we need to secure raw materials, like the other speakers were referencing, creation of the drug product, which requires fill finish capacity, and securing components or enough components such as syringes, stoppers, and needles which we need to have on hand to be able to have the drug product.
> 
> We delivered this season 2 million doses of Beyfortus globally. So we actually delivered more than we had anticipated, or were asked to deliver by initial demand forecasts. 
> 
> And the complex process that has to-- we have to undergo to ensure demand is met needs significant advanced planning, as I mentioned before.
> 
> The unprecedented demand that we've seen in Beyfortus in the U.S. has thus required us to ensure that we are planning to increase the supply and meet demand and scale up production is on the way for the next season, where we would have Beyfortus implemented. So I'm talking about the 24-25 season, right now.
> 
> And our ability to do this is really dependent on the collaboration and partnership with Sanofi, our partner, and also as you can see on the slide, the White House, FDA, CDC, and other stakeholders in this process to ensure that we could meet the needs fully for the next season.
> 
> ...
> 
> Jeanne Santoli, CDC [00:43:35]
> 
> CDC purchases vaccines for its routine programs using contracts for pediatrics and adults. 
> 
> So this includes, we've got flu vaccine contracts, COVID 19 vaccine contracts and then contracts for the other vaccines that are used. And each contract includes a requirement for manufacturers to provide advanced notice of vaccine supply issues as soon as they become aware that they will have an inability to fill orders timely. 
> 
> The contracts also require manufacturers in the event of a shortage to demonstrate reasonably equal treatment between the public and private sectors. And so with these requirements, CDC is provided with some visibility about upcoming issues, and also is able to set expectations about equity between the public and private sectors when there is a supply constraint. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Jeanne Santoli, CDC [00:44:30]
> 
> Once CDC receives notification from a manufacturer about an anticipated problem, we then seek permission to share confidential information with manufacturers of alternative products who may be in a position to mitigate the situation. 
> 
> So the information is quite limited. It's sort of need to know information such as the size of the gap and the anticipated timeframe of the gap. And the information that's shared is really for just internal discussions, among key planning staff. It's not to be shared widely within the company and it's not to be made public. 
> 
> We also maintain a regular point of contact and communicate as needed with CBER's product shortage coordinator and CDC staff meet with stakeholders to review and update messaging, and that includes provider organizations, public health organizations, FDA colleagues, and CDC disease subject matter experts. 
> 
> And then lastly, we maintain a public facing webpage on which we post information about supply shortages of routinely recommended vaccines, next slide. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Jeanne Santoli, CDC [00:45:58]
> 
> I just wanted to talk about a few strategies for mitigating a vaccine shortage. 
> 
> The first strategy involves the pediatric vaccine stockpile program. This is part of the Vaccines for Children program, and it allows CDC to use VFC funding to purchase and manage stockpiles. The stockpiles are dynamic storage and rotation stockpiles, they're held by the manufacturer so they can rotate through manufacture inventory, and that ensures vaccine viability in the stockpile and it reduces waste. 
> 
> The target size for the stockpile is defined as a six month supply of VFC vaccine usage and the stockpile contracts that we have with manufacturers allow us to loan stockpile vaccines to them to mitigate shortages and vaccines are then replaced following the shortage. Next slide.
> 
> A second strategy is controlled vaccine ordering. So when supply is reduced, CDC implements ordering controls in the public sector to mitigate the effects of the shortage and these controls place limits on the total number of vaccines that each jurisdiction can order and jurisdictions are then responsible for making important decisions about how much vaccine will be made available to individual providers and to provider types. 
> 
> Ordering limits are calculated to facilitate jurisdictions, having an access to an equitable share of the vaccine or product that's available. And so they actually mirror the relative proportions of each jurisdiction's ordering for similar vaccines and or similar cohorts when supplies are not constrained.
> 
> Manufacturers also often implement ordering controls in the private sector. The approach that they use varies by manufacturer, and it also takes into account direct ordering as well as ordering through wholesalers and distributors. Next slide. 
> 
> Finally, if there's insufficient vaccine available to fulfill ACIP's recommended vaccination schedule, then interim vaccine recommendations can be issued by CDC and an interim vaccine recommendation is a temporary change in the recommended schedule that's made to conserve limited supply recommendations may either temporarily target limited supply to high risk individuals, or may reduce the number of doses in a multi-dose series. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Jeanne Santoli, CDC [00:52:33]
> 
> As a new product, nirsevimab is not yet held in CDC stockpile. So stockpile was not an option here, but a number of actions were taken. You've just heard about some of this, but there was collaboration between the USG and the manufacturers to manage orders and increased national supply. 
> 
> And this collaboration occurred at multiple levels of all of the involved organizations and, you know, remarkably an additional 300,000 doses were made available in the public and private sectors during this first season. And that actually reflected a 30% increase over what was planned and was very important in trying to meet some of the unanticipated demand and then discussions, which were ongoing, included a major focus on planning for the next season, because while there was a goal to manage the current season as best as possible, it was understood that starting to plan early for the next season was a key strategy. 
> 
> CDC provided guidance on prioritizing nirsevimab in mid-October with a focus on the hundred milligram presentation that was most constrained. And then ordering controls were implemented in the public and private sectors to facilitate equity across the country because initial ordering was significantly varied and uneven across different parts of the country.

- **Date:** occurred February 22, 2024

> Rachel Levine, HHS [00:08:44]
> 
> Unfortunately, measles, one of the most contagious diseases, has made me very concerned. 
> 
> I appreciate NVAC's proactive approach over the years in sessions about localized outbreaks and preventative measures we can take to prevent measles.
> 
> While measles had been eradicated in the United States more than 20 years ago, we have seen recent cases in several states in 2023 alone, a total of 58 measles cases were reported in 20 jurisdictions around the country. And this year CDC has confirmed more cases. 
> 
> Most of these cases were among children and adolescents who were not fully vaccinated to protect them from getting measles if exposed.
> 
> As you well know, measles outbreaks can happen anywhere people are unvaccinated or under vaccinated. While most children in the United States are up to date with their measles vaccinations, too many of our children still need protection. 
> 
> Recent data from the CDC show that 91% of children under age two years have received the recommended two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. This is lower than the Healthy People 2030 goal of 95%. 
> 
> Additionally, some communities have even lower vaccination coverage that puts them at greater risk for outbreaks. 
> 
> I look forward to hearing more about the presentations from the speakers today as the committee discusses both the global surge and measle cases and recent outbreaks in Idaho and Pennsylvania. 
> 
> I also want to encourage the healthcare providers participating in the meeting today to be on the alert for patients with febrile rash and measles symptoms, such as cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, and those who recently traveled abroad, especially to areas with ongoing measles outbreaks, to be effective in our disease prevention goals. 
> 
> We must also fully use them to get more people vaccinated. For example, requiring vaccination for kids in school, a topic on your agenda is key to reducing preventable illnesses. 
> 
> Other evidence-based approaches that promote uptake of vaccinations include patient reminders and recalls, standing orders and incentives to patients and families to overcome hesitancy, a healthcare providers strong and clear recommendation as described in NVAC standards for immunization practice, are central to promoting vaccine uptake and reducing vaccine hesitancy.
> 
> ...
> 
> Natasha Crowcroft, WHO [00:26:29]
> 
> If you look through the top panel in this, what really jumps out is the big peak in 2019. That was a very bad year for measles globally. We have-- that there were more cases in that year than we'd seen since 1996. 
> 
> So we had this very, very big outbreak year. And then following that year 2019, you see the numbers really fall away. And that reflects the impact of the pandemic with shut with lockdowns and reduction in international travel. 
> 
> What's concerning us right now is if you see 2022, cases went, started to go up, and then in 2023, they went up further and we're a little bit concerned we're now in the same or similar position to what we see epidemiologically in run up to that 2019 year, where suddenly we had this explosion of cases. And that's, that's, what's troubling us right now. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Natasha Crowcroft, WHO [00:27:32]
> 
> What we're also seeing that accompanies this concern about the pattern in cases is an increase in outbreaks. So the number of large or disruptive outbreaks, which is defined as a country with an instance more than 20 per million, that has increased from 32 in the whole of 2022 to 51 in 2023.
> 
> There have been ongoing large or disruptive outbreaks in the African region. So the more recent increase has actually mainly been observed in these Eastern Mediterranean region and the European region, and to some extent in Southeast Asia, but we'll hear more about Euro shortly next. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Natasha Crowcroft, WHO [00:28:14]
> 
> The reason for this, why is it happening? Well, we really haven't seen the recovery in measles vaccine coverage globally, as we've seen for other antigens. 
> 
> So DTP coverage rose to within 1% of its pre pandemic levels, but measles containing vaccine, the first dose coverage remain 3% below the pre pandemic peak. And we already know that that was not high enough because we need 95% coverage in the routine program to avoid outbreaks. So we are still a way off that globally. 
> 
> And if you go to the next slide please, what we see in low income countries is actually backsliding. So, rather than not recovering as well, we actually see a fall backwards. So we've lost 7% in our coverage in low income countries. We're already way behind in low income countries, but they've fallen even further. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Natasha Crowcroft, WHO [00:29:48]
> 
> What we're seeing is that more than half of the countries in the world will be at high risk of measles outbreaks by the end of 2024. And about half of those are lower middle income countries. 
> 
> It adds up to 142 million children under five being susceptible to measles, and most of those live in low or middle income countries, and 62% in settings where we identify those countries to be at highest or high risk of an outbreak by the end of this year. 
> 
> So we are, we are really looking at this year with a great deal of concern and hoping that we're going to be wrong because this is a prediction we don't know what's gonna really happen, we're hoping that that action will be taken to catch up and fill these immunity gaps, urgently, to prevent outbreaks occurring. 
> 
> ...
> 
> José Hagan, WHO [00:45:55]
> 
> During the current resurgence, we're seeing that there's a predominance of cases under age five. There are some cases among older children and young adults, accounting for age distribution of the population, it's still overwhelmingly the youngest children. 
> 
> This is very different than what we saw during the peak of the 2018-2019 resurgence. And that was a much wider age range that was affected, including older children and adults. And that really reflected, what Natasha referred to, which is this residual immunity gaps across multiple birth cohorts, resulting from sins of the long past and this relative period of peace time in our region with very low levels of endemic transmission, where this population immunity gap was not challenged by large scale importation of the virus.
> 
> What we're currently experiencing really is the results of accumulation of susceptible children who were not reached by immunization programs that were impacted by the COVID pandemic.
> 
> ...
> 
> José Hagan, WHO [00:47:07]
> 
> We are experiencing a number of outbreaks in the European region. Most predominantly, this is in the Eastern part of the region and central Asia, but it's affecting most of the countries to some degree or another.
> 
> These outbreaks began in 2023. And for the most part, we see a plateau in Europe except for an overwhelming outbreak in Azerbaijan. There have been ongoing outbreak response activities. And I think hopefully we'll see the impact of those in the next couple of months.
> 
> But you know, these outbreaks are really revealing vulnerabilities, particularly these middle income countries and the need for us to really better understand the subnational inequities and overcoming the uncertainties and denominators that make national immunization coverage not reliable, as many of the affected countries really report actually very high coverage at the national level.
> 
> ...
> 
> Christine Hahn, Idaho Division of Public Health [01:02:53]
> 
> We had a young adult male who traveled internationally. 
> 
> I will say, we did not release the country because it is a rural community. We thought it could be identifying, but it was in the European region, in one of the countries alluded to by one of the previous speakers, and returned to back to Idaho on September 13th.
> 
> ...
> 
> Christine Hahn, Idaho Division of Public Health [01:07:07]
> 
> We do know that the public concern is pretty low. We were surprised we thought would get a ton of media attention around our measles outbreak. 
> 
> And it was really, they certainly reported on it, but there really wasn't-- we actually watched our MMR to see if we'd see a bump, after all our press releases and blogs, and we did not see a bump in MM after that at. Very disappointing.
> 
> We have a high exemption rate and we are concerned that as you all know, exempted kids do not necessarily mean unimmunized kids. We think some of these are parents that just don't want to report anything about their children's health or healthcare to a school. 
> 
> But we are concerned that that same reflection of parents that don't necessarily want the government in their business is going to maybe make it challenging for us moving forward to try to improve vaccination rates and maybe hopefully reduce exemption rates in those communities.

> This hasn't been explicitly commented upon yet, but I think people traveling to let's say Africa or Southeast Asia may go to travel clinics and make sure they're up to date on their immunizations, but travelers going to the European region, from the United States, don't necessarily think that way and may not be getting their MMRs before European travel.

> Shara Epstein, Philadelphia Department of Public Health [01:24:21]
> 
> I'll just mention our vaccination rates in Philadelphia, like across the nation fell during the COVID pandemic, but are back on the upswing no.
> 
> 93% of our children, six and older, are up to date on their vaccine. 97% of our school-aged children at seventh grade are up to date on their MMR vaccine.
> 
> I think our cases here in Philadelphia, while they clustered in a daycare that was accepting of unvaccinated children, were not in a kind of specific community. 
> 
> They-- people had whose children who were not vaccinated, who were included in this outbreak, had various reasons for not vaccinating. They weren't-- they weren't consistent. 
> 
> And, in fact, I'll mention that a lot of the kind of preschool children actually had older siblings who were vaccinated. So these weren't kind of long held beliefs in most cases about not vaccinating, which may be different than some other outbreaks.
> 
> ...
> 
> Shara Epstein, Philadelphia Department of Public Health [01:27:58]
> 
> We've also discussed that extensively.
> 
> Our initial case was, while too young to get routine vaccinations, would have been old enough to get an early vaccine for travel, and could have prevented our whole cluster, had they done that. So that's something we've discussed a lot and are very interested in.
> 
> ...
> 
> Natasha Crowcroft, WHO [01:28:30]
> 
> If I should go ahead and answer the question about why measles vaccine hasn't caught up as quickly as diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, I think it is age related. 
> 
> We generally find that coverage at a global level and in many low income countries gets lower, the older the child. 
> 
> So, DTP being given to young infants, and generally we're talking about the first dose of measles vaccine given at nine months, although seeing in some countries given in at 12 or older, but for the countries we're talking about, it's generally nine months. 
> 
> So we already have a problem with a drop off. And then if we have a system that isn't working that well, then it finds it even harder to recover for those older children. 
> 
> On top of that, many low income countries really struggle to immunize children in the first year of-- in the second year of life. So, they-- the essential program of immunization was originally really just for children under one. And even though there's been a recommendation for immunization to be whole of life, and for children to be eligible for their infant vaccines up to five at very least, actually moving those changes along in the field has proved quite challenging in some settings. 
> 
> So, I think that's the other reason that if a child has delayed their dose for one reason or another, is just very, very hard to reach them in the second year of life in some countries.

- **Date:** occurred February 21, 2024

> Dylan George, CDC [12:52:36]
> 
> Through the ongoing collaboration with our colleagues in NCIRD, the data office, EZID, and the global health center, we have used wastewater and syndromic data to develop state level forecasts for COVID 19. 
> 
> We have found by layering in wastewater data, we see more accurate forecast. Now this makes complete sense because it's a leading indicator of what's going on with circulation in the community. And it helps us know when there's going to be peaks or troughs, going forward. 
> 
> This has been a major advancement that wouldn't have happened as fast if it weren't for CFA being in existence.
> 
> We're also making advances on how we use data and improve our forecasting capabilities broadly. 
> 
> CFA has refactored the code that was used for COVID forecasting by the response team making-- we've made it much more robust, portable, reproducible, and efficient.
> 
> The models that are used for COVID 19 forecasting, they run 10 times faster and with better data processing, so partners can respond to future outbreaks more quickly and more efficiently. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kate Wolff, CDC [00:05:54]
> 
> So we ended up with about 160 discrete actions that are bucketed in all of these areas. And I'm really excited to tell you that, right now, we're-- we've completed more than 75% of those actions with the remaining 25 on track to be completed over the course of this next year. 
> 
> Some of the actions, and I'll talk specifically through, some of the critical areas, but we have things that were sort of one and done pieces of, like changes to a specific policy or making sure that the right communications people were involved in the right response activities. You know, those sorts of changes internally. 
> 
> We also have a lot of actions that are requiring ongoing implementation efforts. So we are monitoring the implementation of those actions, continuing to iterate as appropriate. 
> 
> And as Mandy discussed this morning, really looking at the next chapter of moving forward to be that strong foundational base of operational excellence across CDC, that will help us really succeed in the priority areas that we've identified as an agency. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kate Wolff, CDC [00:07:51]
> 
> So one of the places that really came to light through the process that Mary and Jim and others worked through was to make sure that our-- we're getting science out faster. 
> 
> This is something that Deb-- Deb and team have worked very closely on, and with our team at the office of science, and the clearance process is a place where we're really seeing the improvement here. 
> 
> Our process now has allowed us to cut review times in half. And we have improved-- we have 120% CDC wide improvement in our clearance rate. So we're really proud of this. 
> 
> And then I think the other place that you're seeing this is other ways that we're communicating science. 
> 
> So as part of our respiratory virus response, this fall, we were posting weekly updates on our website of here's what we know about the latest variant or here's the latest update about vaccination. Here's what we're seeing in the data. So really trying to use all of the tools that we have available to us to communicate the science that we have. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kate Wolff, CDC [00:11:10]
> 
> Our website has hundreds of hundreds of thousands of webpages on it. And we have been working really hard to go through every single one of those to make sure that the information that we have available to the public is useful and meaningful and appropriate for that audience. 
> 
> We are relaunching our website here this spring. And so we'll keep you all posted as those websites get updated, but we're expecting that we'll have a reduction of at least 64% of our current content as part of this process, and to no raise any alarm, we are archiving everything, so we will still have everything available. 
> 
> And so we can go find anything that we would need, but at least, we expect that this will really enhance the usability of our website for a broad public. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kate Wolff, CDC [00:20:28]
> 
> That's a great flag, and is something that we are actively looking at right now related to the graduated response framework, because it does, in some ways box us in right, as you know, when it gets implemented. 
> 
> So, you know, this year, just as an example, when we came out of the public health emergency last spring, coming into this fall and winter respiratory virus season, we as an agency were thinking about how do we organize ourselves when we don't-- we're not in an emergency, but we have an issue where we need all hands on deck and across agency systems. 
> 
> So what ended up happening and what I think worked well though I know we need to make some tweaks as we think about it going forward, is that NCIRD set up a respiratory virus response group, and that included all of our enterprisewide functions. 
> 
> So data, lab, science, comms, OCU, our operations folks, Leandra, and our office of health equity, plus the flu team, the COVID team, the RSV team plus Les's team plus all of senior, you know, everybody was really invited to sit at that table and participate. 
> 
> And, it wasn't a formal response structure. Like there were pieces of it that mirrored it, like we ended up setting up, you know, a a channel for our comms folks, right. To make sure that everybody was getting the communications materials. 
> 
> We had regular meetings that went through a sit rep, and then here's the issue, so learning some of those lessons, but sort of without as much of the formal structure of an IMS system. And I think that worked well for us with the one caveat that this is an agency that when something says response in the title, they feel a certain way about it, right? And you behave a certain way, so we're going to work through some of that going forward, but that all hands on deck on something that wasn't technically an emergency was a somewhat of a new feeling for folks. 
> 
> And, I think we learned a lot of good lessons there. That's all to say that we're trying to think through now, the graduated response framework, and see if we can figure out what-- how we make that fit. 
> 
> And similarly thinking about the mpox response, and now thinking about the next mpox response, like what's-- what's the right way to lean in, make sure that we are organized and prepared and leaning in, so we're ready should we need to go into that emergency phase, in a way that is not, everybody's not constantly in an emergency response, so it's a tough balance. I don't know Deb, if you wanna say anything else about that. 
> 
> Deb Houry, CDC [00:23:42]
> 
> No I mean, I agree with what Kate said. 
> 
> I think, we're just trying to get past-- people react to the word response as well, you know, cause it-- we've heard from some of our staff that get PTSD when we're talking about response, because they feel like they've been in response for a bit. 
> 
> So how do we more routinize it and be prepared. And so I think that's what we're trying to do is make sure people have enough awareness, but it is being more programmatic in nature where we can.

> There are currently no cases of measles in New York State outside of New York City. For details on measles cases in NYC, please inquire with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
> 
> Additional Information:
> 
> Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus that is spread by direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of infected people, via person-to-person respiratory transmission, or touching a contaminated surface and then touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.  
> 
> To prevent the spread of illness, the Department is advising individuals who may have been exposed and who have symptoms consistent with measles to contact their health care provider, a local clinic, or a local emergency department before going for care.  
> 
> The single best way to prevent measles is to be vaccinated. Individuals should receive two doses of MMR vaccine to be protected. If a person is unsure if they are immune they should contact their healthcare provider.  
> 
> The Department carefully monitors for potential measles cases and is prepared to respond if a case is detected.  
> 
> Please see our measles webpage for more information.

## CDC spokesperson on measles importations

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson Jasmine Reed
- **Date:** received February 16, 2024

> Currently large outbreaks are ongoing in many Asian, Middle Eastern, African, and European countries. Because measles remains a common disease in many parts of the world, we are seeing cases brought into the United States by unvaccinated U.S. residents following international travel. 
> 
> Declines in measles vaccination rates globally have increased the risk of larger measles outbreaks worldwide, including in the United States. When community protection drops, we know that unvaccinated people are at risk.  To prevent measles infection and importation, all U.S. residents should be up to date on their MMR vaccinations prior to international travel. The measles vaccine is highly protective. One dose of the MMR vaccine provides 93% protection against measles and two doses provide 97% protection. For more information, visit Plan for Travel - Measles | CDC.

- **Source:** [livestream](https://youtu.be/c5hYh5XO7qY)
- **Attribution:** hosted by the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic
- **Date:** broadcasted February 15, 2024

> Rep Mariannette Miller-Meeks [11:49:55]
> 
> I understand that the FDA has recommended periodic updates to vaccine composition. As we have seen with influenza, a clear framework for strained selection supports the timely availability of a diverse supply of COVID 19 vaccine platforms. 
> 
> I believe that multiple FDA approved vaccine options can play a role in preserving consumer choice of products and ensuring equity of access, both of which can contribute to increased consumer acceptance and uptake of vaccines without forcing Americans to receive a specific option. 
> 
> Can you please speak to how the agency is taking steps to ensure vaccine manufacturers have the essential time needed to adapt their products accordingly and scaled up production for vaccines for new virus variants?
> 
> Peter Marks, FDA [11:50:42]
> 
> Congress member Miller Meeks, thanks very much for that question.
> 
> I would certainly agree with you that at FDA, we take seriously the need to have choice among vaccines, because that will allow a greater vaccination rate because we understand that some people may not feel comfortable with certain types of vaccines. They may want a more traditional vaccine, rather than a newer vaccine. 
> 
> That's why we've been continuing to work with manufacturers to try to make sure that when we roll out the next update, we will have a diversity of choice, of at least more than one type of vaccine that will be available. 
> 
> So you will see, as we move into the spring, we will, as you've noted, go through a strain selection process. We're already having dialogue with manufacturers to help them get prepared because there's a lot of pre-work that they can do at risk to prepare for this, so that we can hopefully have the choice that you're talking about.

## FDA commissioner at National Press Club event

- **Source:** [livestream](https://youtu.be/k1TFyQtJgQs)
- **Attribution:** hosted by the National Press Club
- **Date:** broadcasted February 14, 2024

> Robert Califf, FDA [00:13:19]
> 
> Let me just offer you a recent example of a situation where the focus on the sensational took precedence on this topic. 
> 
> Several weeks ago, media outlets from around the world reported on the Florida surgeon generals unfounded call to halt to COVID vaccines. It was a splashy news story, easy to report and filled with conflict, albeit unmerited. 
> 
> In fact, only a few weeks earlier, the FDA publicly shared a letter we sent to the Florida surgeon general on the precise, underlying issue he raised. We outlined the implausibility of it and reinforced the thorough scientific assessments that give the FDA confidence in the quality, safety and effectiveness of the vaccines. No drama, just facts.
> 
> Not surprisingly only one or two reporters wrote about it then. 
> 
> Make no mistake, it's important for the public to understand a range of views to help inform their own opinion, but too often, the panoply of stories to which people are exposed causes them to lose sight of the underlying issues that would enable them to live longer free of hospitalization and disability. 
> 
> Instead they're often given equal or a greater print or air time to a relatively small but persistent group of stories and opinions that have the benefit of generating controversy, even when those reports are based on views that disagree with and do not represent the vast majority of expert opinion.
> 
> This trend of both side ism and free balance, it's not a new issue. You know about it. 
> 
> In the example, I just noted the stories were about one outspoken surgeon general who opposes vaccine. A simple review of the landscape reveals that almost all other surgeon generals and state health officials support the widespread use of vaccines. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:35:54]
> 
> Well, one day I look forward to giving all my thoughts on the lawsuit, but it's a case in action, so I'm very restricted in what I can say beyond what I've already said multiple times. 
> 
> I think the beauty of the American system, which is the envy of the world, is that we have a strong FDA with about, I don't know, a handful of us, maybe five or six who are political appointees. All the rest are full-time civil servants with no financial conflict of interest, under heavy scrutiny, who have no mission other than the public health of the U.S. and who have expertise in weighing the risk and benefits based on the evidence.
> 
> They did that for mifepristone. The answer's been consistent at the FDA. It's not changing. We stand behind the science. And I have also already publicly expressed worry about eroding that. 
> 
> And I know people who depend on good knowing that the medicines they're taking are safe and effective have expressed worry that undermining that civil service weighing of risk and benefit based on evidence could really have bad consequences for the future.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:42:58]
> 
> So one thing we're very worried about, and throughout HHS, is that right now the wealthy and highly educated are basically getting access to this treatment and people who may need it the most can't get access. That's a concern.
> 
> But you mentioned that, what's being told to the public and we regulate the advertising done by those who make the drug and sell it. But we don't regulate third parties who start clinics and sell things over the internet. 
> 
> And I've recently been noticing a number of these ads that don't give the whole risk benefit story, and we don't have authority to really regulate these folks. So it's an interesting component of it.

## Oregon Health Authority spokesperson on changes to COVID-19 guidance

- **Attribution:** Oregon Health Authority spokesperson Afiq Hisham
- **Date:** received February 13, 2024

> Thanks for reaching out, we do appreciate your patience. Regarding data OHA provided to ASTHO on COVID-19, we mentioned not seeing any disproportionate increases in the severity of illness since we changed the state’s isolation guidelines.
> 
> Our change in isolation recommendations last year was very much evidence-based and informed by our understanding of transmission. This change acknowledged that isolation alone (i.e., in the absence of additional protective measures such as universal masking) was doing almost nothing to halt transmission at the community level.
> 
> Here’s some information we shared with the New York Times that may help with your coverage –
> 
> Data points to support no disproportionate increase in community transmission or severity:
> Hospitalizations - below is a graph of COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates in Oregon as well as three additional jurisdictions (CA, CO, NY). Of note, no disproportionate increase was observed in Oregon's hospitalization rates following the May 2023 policy change. These data are from the COVID-NET interactive dashboard: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covidnetdashboard/de/powerbi/dashboard.html

> Deaths — Below are two graphs of COVID-19-associated death rates in Oregon and the United States. Of note, no disproportionate increase was observed in Oregon’s death rates following the May 2023 policy change. These data are from the CDC COVID Data Tracker: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_weeklydeathrateaa_00

> 
> It’s also important to consider that isolation is a policy that is typically used when the public health goal is to contain an infection. That is not OHA’s goal. Our goal is to help people in Oregon make informed decisions to protect themselves from severe infection—to understand who is at increased risk, who should be vaccinated, when to consider masking, when to test, how to interpret test results, and when to seek care given the current levels of COVID-19 transmission in Oregon.
> 
> ...
> 
> Sure thing, Alexander. OHA did discuss our isolation policy changes and related data on regional partner calls which included CDC representatives.

> As we discussed on the phone, the answer to the question you posed is NO, BA.2.87.1 was NOT sequenced from a traveler who traveled through Newark last year. The sample referred to in the post was missing regions that would be defining for BA.2.87 and did not meet standards to conclusively identify BA.2.87 based on current lineage definitions (<70% genome coverage).

## CDC official on need for Vaccines for Adults program

- **Date:** broadcasted February 7, 2024

> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:02:54]
> 
> As you probably know, CDC just recently this past fall launched the CDC Bridge Access Program for COVID 19 vaccines. This is a very exciting short term solution to provide continued access for adults to free COVID 19 vaccination, regardless of their insurance status. 
> 
> However, it's called the Bridge Access Program for a reason, and it must be a bridge to somewhere that's somewhere. And I'll agree with Peschin, we can agree on the name later, but that somewhere needs to be vaccines for adults, vaccines for all, or a program that will really complement what we've already done with vaccines for children and our 317 program, to bring vaccines to all people, regardless of their insurance status.
> 
> A comprehensive immunization program, like the kind I'm talking about that addresses needs from childhood through adulthood is a cornerstone of maintaining optimal health, as well as for preparing for any public health emergency that might come our way. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:23:05]
> 
> So through this sort of complement of availability, we've been able to reach quite a few adults. We've had about 1.2 million vaccines out the door through this program thus far, and are just hoping for ever more every day. 
> 
> I do want to speak to one really, really, really important limitation of the bridge-- actually, I'll go ahead and add in a second, two critical limitations. 
> 
> One, it is only COVID 19 vaccine. I know I'm preaching to the choir here, so I won't talk about that too long. But COVID 19 vaccine is not the only vaccine that adults are recommended to receive. And so this is not the comprehensive program that we need. It's not the comprehensive infrastructure that we need to provide equitable immunization, across the spectrum of needed vaccines. That's the first really important critical limitation. 
> 
> The second is a sustainability. The bridge access program will end by December 2024. That is this year. So we have part of one more vaccine season left to go. 
> 
> We are of course working to see if there's any way that we can extend this, but as it now stands, this will end. This was meant to be a temporary bridge to a more permanent solution like VFA. And I do hope that we get there.
> 
> ...
> 
> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:45:54]
> 
> Long term care facilities are largely filled with patients that have insurance. And so in theory, they're not the target of the Bridge Access Program. In theory, they wouldn't be part of VFA, but VFA would benefit them. And I'll tell you, this is why we've been working so hard to enroll long term care facilities under eTrueNorth in the Bridge Access Program. 
> 
> Because exactly like Peschin said, many of these facilities are staffed largely by uninsured adults. And again, viruses don't respect borders. They don't respect station either. 
> 
> Like whether you're a patient or a provider, you're equally likely to get a virus. And I know that the care providers for these patients in long-term care facilities certainly don't want to be the person that their patient caught flu from or caught COVID from.

- **Date:** received February 7, 2024

> **How often does FDA ask drugmakers for updates of availability of these ADHD drugs in shortage?**
> 
> The FDA regularly works with manufacturers to evaluate the entire supply chain of drug products to help prevent or reduce the impact of a drug shortage. For a drug in shortage, we are continuous contact with the manufacturers to get the latest info and we update our website daily.
> 
> **How is FDA calculating total national historical demand, to decide that they are still in shortage?**
> 
> The FDA receives information provided by manufacturers regarding their ability to supply the market, as well as market sales data on the specific products, then lists drugs on its shortages website once it has confirmed that overall market demand is not being met by the manufacturers of the product. The FDA does not consider a product to be in shortage if one or more manufacturers are able to fully supply market demand for the product.

## CDC spokesperson on influenza trends so far

- **Source:** emailed statement

- **Date:** received February 1, 2024

> After several weeks of declining flu activity indicators, some CDC surveillance systems have shown increases in parts of the country in recent weeks. It is not unusual for there to be a slight increase in activity during the weeks following holidays. During some seasons this is the start of a second wave of activity; in other seasons, it is a slight increase in activity prior to activity decreasing toward the spring. CDC is closely monitoring activity and will continue to provide weekly updates via FluView.

## CDC clinician outreach call regarding influenza

> Tim Uyeki, CDC [00:02:49]
> 
> I'm going to summarize influenza activity this season and cover disease burden. Next slide. 
> 
> So this slide shows influenza positive tests that are reported to CDC from clinical laboratories throughout the U.S. it's by a weekly basis, as of a week ago. 
> 
> And what you can see from the slide is that, although the numbers of positive tests peaked at the very end of the year, there's still a substantial amount of influenza activity occurring in the U.S.
> 
> From public health laboratory testing, we know that the majority of influenza viruses circulating this season in the U.S. are influenza A viruses and of those, the vast majority have been influenza A H1N1 pdm09 viruses, with a smaller proportion of H3N2 viruses and overall influenza B viruses have been circulating, but to a much lower extent. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Tim Uyeki, CDC [00:09:22]
> 
> So in terms of estimated disease burden, what you see on the upper right figure is 12 influenza seasons. It excludes data from the 2020 to 2021 season where we saw very, very little influenza activity in the U.S. and actually worldwide because of probably because of non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented to control the COVID 19 pandemic, but a wide range of disease severity from season to season. 
> 
> We see seasonal epidemics that result in estimated deaths of about 5,000 to about 52,000 per season, and then hospitalizations wide range for anywhere from estimated a hundred thousand to 710,000 in a more severe season. About 9.4 to 41 million illnesses occurring. 
> 
> And you can see from the top figure on the right that, among those 12 seasons, the most severe we had was during the 2017-2018 influenza epidemic in the U.S., which is the higher range of 710,000 estimated hospitalizations and 52,000 estimated deaths.
> 
> For this season, preliminary estimates as of January 20th, and we'll update these regularly as we have data, estimated 18 to 35 million illnesses have occurred anywhere from 8.4 to 16 million medical visits, 210,000 to 440,000 hospitalizations and 13,000 to 38,000 deaths. 
> 
> So based on these data, we would classify the season to date as a moderate season in terms of disease severity. There's much more influenza still to go, although nationally we have peaked. 
> 
> And just to say that, although I showed that hospitalization rates are highest in people 65 years and older, mortality rates are also much, much skewed towards people 65 years and older, they're much higher the older you are above 65 years old. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Tim Uyeki, CDC [00:36:12]
> 
> So just as a reminder, as I mentioned, although the influenza season has peaked nationally, there's still a lot of influenza viruses circulating throughout the U.S. A lot of communities are still influenza. We do expect influenza activity to continue for many weeks to come this season. 
> 
> So for unvaccinated people, I want to remind clinicians and public health colleagues that vaccination is the most effective way to protect patients against influenza.
