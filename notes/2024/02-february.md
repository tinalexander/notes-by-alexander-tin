- **Date:** received February 16, 2024

> Measles is always a cause for concern and as soon as a case is identified, the city takes action to identify anyone who may have been exposed, provide guidance, and connect people with appropriate resources. The single most important thing we can do to be safe is to get vaccinated.

## New York State spokesperson on measles case

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** New York State Department of Health spokesperson Cadence Acquaviva
- **Date:** received February 16, 2024

> There are currently no cases of measles in New York State outside of New York City. For details on measles cases in NYC, please inquire with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
> 
> Additional Information:
> 
> Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus that is spread by direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of infected people, via person-to-person respiratory transmission, or touching a contaminated surface and then touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.  
> 
> To prevent the spread of illness, the Department is advising individuals who may have been exposed and who have symptoms consistent with measles to contact their health care provider, a local clinic, or a local emergency department before going for care.  
> 
> The single best way to prevent measles is to be vaccinated. Individuals should receive two doses of MMR vaccine to be protected. If a person is unsure if they are immune they should contact their healthcare provider.  
> 
> The Department carefully monitors for potential measles cases and is prepared to respond if a case is detected.  
> 
> Please see our measles webpage for more information.

## CDC spokesperson on measles importations

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson Jasmine Reed
- **Date:** received February 16, 2024

> Currently large outbreaks are ongoing in many Asian, Middle Eastern, African, and European countries. Because measles remains a common disease in many parts of the world, we are seeing cases brought into the United States by unvaccinated U.S. residents following international travel. 
> 
> Declines in measles vaccination rates globally have increased the risk of larger measles outbreaks worldwide, including in the United States. When community protection drops, we know that unvaccinated people are at risk.  To prevent measles infection and importation, all U.S. residents should be up to date on their MMR vaccinations prior to international travel. The measles vaccine is highly protective. One dose of the MMR vaccine provides 93% protection against measles and two doses provide 97% protection. For more information, visit Plan for Travel - Measles | CDC.

## Federal health officials at House hearing on COVID-19 vaccines

- **Source:** [livestream](https://youtu.be/c5hYh5XO7qY)
- **Attribution:** hosted by the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic
- **Date:** broadcasted February 15, 2024

> Rep Mariannette Miller-Meeks [11:49:55]
> 
> I understand that the FDA has recommended periodic updates to vaccine composition. As we have seen with influenza, a clear framework for strained selection supports the timely availability of a diverse supply of COVID 19 vaccine platforms. 
> 
> I believe that multiple FDA approved vaccine options can play a role in preserving consumer choice of products and ensuring equity of access, both of which can contribute to increased consumer acceptance and uptake of vaccines without forcing Americans to receive a specific option. 
> 
> Can you please speak to how the agency is taking steps to ensure vaccine manufacturers have the essential time needed to adapt their products accordingly and scaled up production for vaccines for new virus variants?
> 
> Peter Marks, FDA [11:50:42]
> 
> Congress member Miller Meeks, thanks very much for that question.
> 
> I would certainly agree with you that at FDA, we take seriously the need to have choice among vaccines, because that will allow a greater vaccination rate because we understand that some people may not feel comfortable with certain types of vaccines. They may want a more traditional vaccine, rather than a newer vaccine. 
> 
> That's why we've been continuing to work with manufacturers to try to make sure that when we roll out the next update, we will have a diversity of choice, of at least more than one type of vaccine that will be available. 
> 
> So you will see, as we move into the spring, we will, as you've noted, go through a strain selection process. We're already having dialogue with manufacturers to help them get prepared because there's a lot of pre-work that they can do at risk to prepare for this, so that we can hopefully have the choice that you're talking about.

## FDA commissioner at National Press Club event

- **Source:** [livestream](https://youtu.be/k1TFyQtJgQs)
- **Attribution:** hosted by the National Press Club
- **Date:** broadcasted February 14, 2024

> Robert Califf, FDA [00:13:19]
> 
> Let me just offer you a recent example of a situation where the focus on the sensational took precedence on this topic. 
> 
> Several weeks ago, media outlets from around the world reported on the Florida surgeon generals unfounded call to halt to COVID vaccines. It was a splashy news story, easy to report and filled with conflict, albeit unmerited. 
> 
> In fact, only a few weeks earlier, the FDA publicly shared a letter we sent to the Florida surgeon general on the precise, underlying issue he raised. We outlined the implausibility of it and reinforced the thorough scientific assessments that give the FDA confidence in the quality, safety and effectiveness of the vaccines. No drama, just facts.
> 
> Not surprisingly only one or two reporters wrote about it then. 
> 
> Make no mistake, it's important for the public to understand a range of views to help inform their own opinion, but too often, the panoply of stories to which people are exposed causes them to lose sight of the underlying issues that would enable them to live longer free of hospitalization and disability. 
> 
> Instead they're often given equal or a greater print or air time to a relatively small but persistent group of stories and opinions that have the benefit of generating controversy, even when those reports are based on views that disagree with and do not represent the vast majority of expert opinion.
> 
> This trend of both side ism and free balance, it's not a new issue. You know about it. 
> 
> In the example, I just noted the stories were about one outspoken surgeon general who opposes vaccine. A simple review of the landscape reveals that almost all other surgeon generals and state health officials support the widespread use of vaccines. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:35:54]
> 
> Well, one day I look forward to giving all my thoughts on the lawsuit, but it's a case in action, so I'm very restricted in what I can say beyond what I've already said multiple times. 
> 
> I think the beauty of the American system, which is the envy of the world, is that we have a strong FDA with about, I don't know, a handful of us, maybe five or six who are political appointees. All the rest are full-time civil servants with no financial conflict of interest, under heavy scrutiny, who have no mission other than the public health of the U.S. and who have expertise in weighing the risk and benefits based on the evidence.
> 
> They did that for mifepristone. The answer's been consistent at the FDA. It's not changing. We stand behind the science. And I have also already publicly expressed worry about eroding that. 
> 
> And I know people who depend on good knowing that the medicines they're taking are safe and effective have expressed worry that undermining that civil service weighing of risk and benefit based on evidence could really have bad consequences for the future.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:42:58]
> 
> So one thing we're very worried about, and throughout HHS, is that right now the wealthy and highly educated are basically getting access to this treatment and people who may need it the most can't get access. That's a concern.
> 
> But you mentioned that, what's being told to the public and we regulate the advertising done by those who make the drug and sell it. But we don't regulate third parties who start clinics and sell things over the internet. 
> 
> And I've recently been noticing a number of these ads that don't give the whole risk benefit story, and we don't have authority to really regulate these folks. So it's an interesting component of it.

## Oregon Health Authority spokesperson on changes to COVID-19 guidance

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** Oregon Health Authority spokesperson Afiq Hisham
- **Date:** received February 13, 2024

> Thanks for reaching out, we do appreciate your patience. Regarding data OHA provided to ASTHO on COVID-19, we mentioned not seeing any disproportionate increases in the severity of illness since we changed the state’s isolation guidelines.
> 
> Our change in isolation recommendations last year was very much evidence-based and informed by our understanding of transmission. This change acknowledged that isolation alone (i.e., in the absence of additional protective measures such as universal masking) was doing almost nothing to halt transmission at the community level.
> 
> Here’s some information we shared with the New York Times that may help with your coverage –
> 
> Data points to support no disproportionate increase in community transmission or severity:
> Hospitalizations - below is a graph of COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates in Oregon as well as three additional jurisdictions (CA, CO, NY). Of note, no disproportionate increase was observed in Oregon's hospitalization rates following the May 2023 policy change. These data are from the COVID-NET interactive dashboard: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covidnetdashboard/de/powerbi/dashboard.html
> 
> [image]
> 
> Deaths — Below are two graphs of COVID-19-associated death rates in Oregon and the United States. Of note, no disproportionate increase was observed in Oregon’s death rates following the May 2023 policy change. These data are from the CDC COVID Data Tracker: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_weeklydeathrateaa_00
> 
> [image]
> 
> [image]
> 
> It’s also important to consider that isolation is a policy that is typically used when the public health goal is to contain an infection. That is not OHA’s goal. Our goal is to help people in Oregon make informed decisions to protect themselves from severe infection—to understand who is at increased risk, who should be vaccinated, when to consider masking, when to test, how to interpret test results, and when to seek care given the current levels of COVID-19 transmission in Oregon.
> 
> ...
> 
> Sure thing, Alexander. OHA did discuss our isolation policy changes and related data on regional partner calls which included CDC representatives.

> As we discussed on the phone, the answer to the question you posed is NO, BA.2.87.1 was NOT sequenced from a traveler who traveled through Newark last year. The sample referred to in the post was missing regions that would be defining for BA.2.87 and did not meet standards to conclusively identify BA.2.87 based on current lineage definitions (<70% genome coverage).

- **Date:** broadcasted February 7, 2024

> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:02:54]
> 
> As you probably know, CDC just recently this past fall launched the CDC Bridge Access Program for COVID 19 vaccines. This is a very exciting short term solution to provide continued access for adults to free COVID 19 vaccination, regardless of their insurance status. 
> 
> However, it's called the Bridge Access Program for a reason, and it must be a bridge to somewhere that's somewhere. And I'll agree with Peschin, we can agree on the name later, but that somewhere needs to be vaccines for adults, vaccines for all, or a program that will really complement what we've already done with vaccines for children and our 317 program, to bring vaccines to all people, regardless of their insurance status.
> 
> A comprehensive immunization program, like the kind I'm talking about that addresses needs from childhood through adulthood is a cornerstone of maintaining optimal health, as well as for preparing for any public health emergency that might come our way. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:23:05]
> 
> So through this sort of complement of availability, we've been able to reach quite a few adults. We've had about 1.2 million vaccines out the door through this program thus far, and are just hoping for ever more every day. 
> 
> I do want to speak to one really, really, really important limitation of the bridge-- actually, I'll go ahead and add in a second, two critical limitations. 
> 
> One, it is only COVID 19 vaccine. I know I'm preaching to the choir here, so I won't talk about that too long. But COVID 19 vaccine is not the only vaccine that adults are recommended to receive. And so this is not the comprehensive program that we need. It's not the comprehensive infrastructure that we need to provide equitable immunization, across the spectrum of needed vaccines. That's the first really important critical limitation. 
> 
> The second is a sustainability. The bridge access program will end by December 2024. That is this year. So we have part of one more vaccine season left to go. 
> 
> We are of course working to see if there's any way that we can extend this, but as it now stands, this will end. This was meant to be a temporary bridge to a more permanent solution like VFA. And I do hope that we get there.
> 
> ...
> 
> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:45:54]
> 
> Long term care facilities are largely filled with patients that have insurance. And so in theory, they're not the target of the Bridge Access Program. In theory, they wouldn't be part of VFA, but VFA would benefit them. And I'll tell you, this is why we've been working so hard to enroll long term care facilities under eTrueNorth in the Bridge Access Program. 
> 
> Because exactly like Peschin said, many of these facilities are staffed largely by uninsured adults. And again, viruses don't respect borders. They don't respect station either. 
> 
> Like whether you're a patient or a provider, you're equally likely to get a virus. And I know that the care providers for these patients in long-term care facilities certainly don't want to be the person that their patient caught flu from or caught COVID from.

- **Date:** received February 7, 2024

> **How often does FDA ask drugmakers for updates of availability of these ADHD drugs in shortage?**
> 
> The FDA regularly works with manufacturers to evaluate the entire supply chain of drug products to help prevent or reduce the impact of a drug shortage. For a drug in shortage, we are continuous contact with the manufacturers to get the latest info and we update our website daily.
> 
> **How is FDA calculating total national historical demand, to decide that they are still in shortage?**
> 
> The FDA receives information provided by manufacturers regarding their ability to supply the market, as well as market sales data on the specific products, then lists drugs on its shortages website once it has confirmed that overall market demand is not being met by the manufacturers of the product. The FDA does not consider a product to be in shortage if one or more manufacturers are able to fully supply market demand for the product.

> After several weeks of declining flu activity indicators, some CDC surveillance systems have shown increases in parts of the country in recent weeks. It is not unusual for there to be a slight increase in activity during the weeks following holidays. During some seasons this is the start of a second wave of activity; in other seasons, it is a slight increase in activity prior to activity decreasing toward the spring. CDC is closely monitoring activity and will continue to provide weekly updates via FluView.

> 
> And what you can see from the slide is that, although the numbers of positive tests peaked at the very end of the year, there's still a substantial amount of influenza activity occurring in the U.S.
> 
> From public health laboratory testing, we know that the majority of influenza viruses circulating this season in the U.S. are influenza A viruses and of those, the vast majority have been influenza A H1N1 pdm09 viruses, with a smaller proportion of H3N2 viruses and overall influenza B viruses have been circulating, but to a much lower extent.

> So in terms of estimated disease burden, what you see on the upper right figure is 12 influenza seasons. It excludes data from the 2020 to 2021 season where we saw very, very little influenza activity in the U.S. and actually worldwide because of probably because of non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented to control the COVID 19 pandemic, but a wide range of disease severity from season to season. 
> 
> We see seasonal epidemics that result in estimated deaths of about 5,000 to about 52,000 per season, and then hospitalizations wide range for anywhere from estimated a hundred thousand to 710,000 in a more severe season. About 9.4 to 41 million illnesses occurring. 
> 
> And you can see from the top figure on the right that, among those 12 seasons, the most severe we had was during the 2017-2018 influenza epidemic in the U.S., which is the higher range of 710,000 estimated hospitalizations and 52,000 estimated deaths.
> 
> For this season, preliminary estimates as of January 20th, and we'll update these regularly as we have data, estimated 18 to 35 million illnesses have occurred anywhere from 8.4 to 16 million medical visits, 210,000 to 440,000 hospitalizations and 13,000 to 38,000 deaths. 
> 
> So based on these data, we would classify the season to date as a moderate season in terms of disease severity. There's much more influenza still to go, although nationally we have peaked. 
> 
> And just to say that, although I showed that hospitalization rates are highest in people 65 years and older, mortality rates are also much, much skewed towards people 65 years and older, they're much higher the older you are above 65 years old. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Tim Uyeki, CDC [00:36:12]
> 
> So just as a reminder, as I mentioned, although the influenza season has peaked nationally, there's still a lot of influenza viruses circulating throughout the U.S. A lot of communities are still influenza. We do expect influenza activity to continue for many weeks to come this season. 
> 
> So for unvaccinated people, I want to remind clinicians and public health colleagues that vaccination is the most effective way to protect patients against influenza.

> Purpose of this Message:
> 
> To inform clinical laboratories of a recall issued by bioMerieux on 1/29/2024 regarding an elevated incidence of false positive Norovirus results from BIOFIRE® FILMARRAY® Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel.
> 
> Action Item:
> 
> • Please review the recall notice (FSCA 5812) for the BIOFIRE® FILMARRAY® Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel.
> 
> • In cases where a positive Norovirus result appears inconsistent with clinical presentation, please refer the specimen to your send out reference lab for confirmation using alternative detection methods.
> 
> • If the confirmation result is discrepant from initial result using the BioFire, report the findings directly to bioMerieux technical support team at biofiresupport@biomerieux.com or via telephone by dialing 1-800-735-6544 and selecting option 5 for Product Technical Support.

> Background:
> 
> Norovirus is the leading causes of vomiting and diarrhea from acute gastroenteritis with most Norovirus outbreaks in the US occurring in November to April. The CDC, along with other state Public Health Laboratories (PHL) including MDH PHL, have expressed concerns regarding an unusual surge in Norovirus positivity detected by the BIOFIRE®, coupled with a low concordance rate observed with alternative detection methods. On 1/29/24 bioMerieux released a recall notice for the BIOFIRE® FILMARRAY® GI Panel, necessitating appropriate follow-up actions.
