## CDC spokesperson on influenza trends so far

> After several weeks of declining flu activity indicators, some CDC surveillance systems have shown increases in parts of the country in recent weeks. It is not unusual for there to be a slight increase in activity during the weeks following holidays. During some seasons this is the start of a second wave of activity; in other seasons, it is a slight increase in activity prior to activity decreasing toward the spring. CDC is closely monitoring activity and will continue to provide weekly updates via FluView.

> Tim Uyeki, CDC [00:02:49]
> 
> I'm going to summarize influenza activity this season and cover disease burden. Next slide. 
> 
> So this slide shows influenza positive tests that are reported to CDC from clinical laboratories throughout the U.S. it's by a weekly basis, as of a week ago. 
> 
> And what you can see from the slide is that, although the numbers of positive tests peaked at the very end of the year, there's still a substantial amount of influenza activity occurring in the U.S.
> 
> From public health laboratory testing, we know that the majority of influenza viruses circulating this season in the U.S. are influenza A viruses and of those, the vast majority have been influenza A H1N1 pdm09 viruses, with a smaller proportion of H3N2 viruses and overall influenza B viruses have been circulating, but to a much lower extent. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Tim Uyeki, CDC [00:09:22]
> 
> So in terms of estimated disease burden, what you see on the upper right figure is 12 influenza seasons. It excludes data from the 2020 to 2021 season where we saw very, very little influenza activity in the U.S. and actually worldwide because of probably because of non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented to control the COVID 19 pandemic, but a wide range of disease severity from season to season. 
> 
> We see seasonal epidemics that result in estimated deaths of about 5,000 to about 52,000 per season, and then hospitalizations wide range for anywhere from estimated a hundred thousand to 710,000 in a more severe season. About 9.4 to 41 million illnesses occurring. 
> 
> And you can see from the top figure on the right that, among those 12 seasons, the most severe we had was during the 2017-2018 influenza epidemic in the U.S., which is the higher range of 710,000 estimated hospitalizations and 52,000 estimated deaths.
> 
> For this season, preliminary estimates as of January 20th, and we'll update these regularly as we have data, estimated 18 to 35 million illnesses have occurred anywhere from 8.4 to 16 million medical visits, 210,000 to 440,000 hospitalizations and 13,000 to 38,000 deaths. 
> 
> So based on these data, we would classify the season to date as a moderate season in terms of disease severity. There's much more influenza still to go, although nationally we have peaked. 
> 
> And just to say that, although I showed that hospitalization rates are highest in people 65 years and older, mortality rates are also much, much skewed towards people 65 years and older, they're much higher the older you are above 65 years old. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Tim Uyeki, CDC [00:36:12]
> 
> So just as a reminder, as I mentioned, although the influenza season has peaked nationally, there's still a lot of influenza viruses circulating throughout the U.S. A lot of communities are still influenza. We do expect influenza activity to continue for many weeks to come this season. 
> 
> So for unvaccinated people, I want to remind clinicians and public health colleagues that vaccination is the most effective way to protect patients against influenza.

> January 31st , 2024
> 
> Purpose of this Message:
> 
> To inform clinical laboratories of a recall issued by bioMerieux on 1/29/2024 regarding an elevated incidence of false positive Norovirus results from BIOFIRE® FILMARRAY® Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel.
> 
> Action Item:
> 
> • Please review the recall notice (FSCA 5812) for the BIOFIRE® FILMARRAY® Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel.
> 
> • In cases where a positive Norovirus result appears inconsistent with clinical presentation, please refer the specimen to your send out reference lab for confirmation using alternative detection methods.
> 
> • If the confirmation result is discrepant from initial result using the BioFire, report the findings directly to bioMerieux technical support team at biofiresupport@biomerieux.com or via telephone by dialing 1-800-735-6544 and selecting option 5 for Product Technical Support. 
> 
> Background:
> 
> Norovirus is the leading causes of vomiting and diarrhea from acute gastroenteritis with most Norovirus outbreaks in the US occurring in November to April. The CDC, along with other state Public Health Laboratories (PHL) including MDH PHL, have expressed concerns regarding an unusual surge in Norovirus positivity detected by the BIOFIRE®, coupled with a low concordance rate observed with alternative detection methods. On 1/29/24 bioMerieux released a recall notice for the BIOFIRE® FILMARRAY® GI Panel, necessitating appropriate follow-up actions.
