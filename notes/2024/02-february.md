> Background:
> 
> Norovirus is the leading causes of vomiting and diarrhea from acute gastroenteritis with most Norovirus outbreaks in the US occurring in November to April. The CDC, along with other state Public Health Laboratories (PHL) including MDH PHL, have expressed concerns regarding an unusual surge in Norovirus positivity detected by the BIOFIRE®, coupled with a low concordance rate observed with alternative detection methods. On 1/29/24 bioMerieux released a recall notice for the BIOFIRE® FILMARRAY® GI Panel, necessitating appropriate follow-up actions.
