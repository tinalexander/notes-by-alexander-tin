## HHS officials at press conference on Baxter IV shortage

- **Source:** recording

> Dawn O'Connell, ASPR [00:31:02]
> 
> One of the concerns we have at ASPR is on the medical health supply chain. 
> 
> As soon as we heard that there was a situation, with the Baxter plant in Marion, we reached out and spoke to the CEO Saturday night. We had our teams meeting for the first time Sunday morning, and we've been meeting daily since then. 
> 
> I think folks know Baxter, has been-- they provide 60% of the nation's IV fluids and we are working to, and they are working and have been a terrific partner in trying to find additional supply. 
> 
> They have fortunately plants across the world that they are looking to access supply from and bring in to be able to staunch which is the difficulty right now for them of being able to access their plant. 
> 
> There was a bridge that went out and that was the bridge that would bring things back and forth. 
> 
> They've been able to for their industry, they've invested in this, on their own, put a rock bridge in to begin to get some of the machines in to help augment and begin to clean up and get it back online. They also had some supply in their plant that they thought was salvageable. They're looking at that to try to get that into the supply chain.
> 
> But from the federal perspective, we've been in lockstep with them helping to secure whatever bridge access they needed, and also to look around for additional suppliers who could fill the gap while they begin to ramp back up. 
> 
> But I will say, it's a concern of ours, but Baxter's been a wonderful partner in trying to minimize the impact on the supply chain. 
> 
> Of course, we saw the east coast port situation get resolved overnight. That was an additional pinch that we were worried about. 
> 
> But that's now less of a concern and we're focused on getting Baxter back up and ready to go. And they've been a terrific partner in all of us and are very concerned about this as well, but we continue to meet regularly to assist.
> 
> ...
> 
> Andrea Palm, HHS [00:32:59]
> 
> I would just say to that end, the Food and Drug Administration, also a member of the HHS family of agencies, and as Dawn noted, there are a couple of other domestic manufacturers for some of these products. 
> 
> And we through our colleagues at FDA are in touch with those manufacturers about the opportunity for them to ramp up as Baxter is getting itself square and assessing their situation and getting back online and back up to full capacity. 
> 
> But we're again, pulling all the levers we have at HHS to make sure we're leaning in to support this work more broadly, including our colleagues at FDA.

- **Date:** occurred October 7, 2024

> Robert Califf, FDA [00:18:29]
> 
> It turns out, a huge part of my time has been taken up, including today, on very basic supply chain issues across every commodity that we regulate in an increasingly complex global, inter-digitated supply chain consumed by just in time low inventory thinking to reduce cost.
> 
> We are seeing shortages and supply chain interruptions, often due to climate change or international strife. 
> 
> And it's a very combustible mix.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:27:21]
> 
> If you look underneath it all, whenever you say government agencies, there's a negative reaction by a large part of our society. 
> 
> Unfortunately, a lot of that's driven by politics and the cultural divide, very hard to deal with. 
> 
> But if you look at people's individual interactions with people that work in these spheres, they're not so negative. 
> 
> And I think you see that right now, going on with Helene, if you're on the ground in the Asheville area, there's a lot of good collaboration and hard work going on. 
> 
> And yet still, if you ask the question is government response adequate, it would break down according to political lines. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:43:13]
> 
> We have hundreds of shortages of drugs, and there's an inverse relationship between the price of the drug and the probability of a shortage with the one exception of the weight loss drugs, which I won't talk about. That's a whole different set of issues.
> 
> And what's happened, it's been called a race to the bottom, as generic drugs, over 90% of our prescriptions have become commoditized, the price has gotten so low that you can't afford to make them and distribute them with U.S. labor costs at the current price. 
> 
> And unfortunately, in my view, the purchasers driven by our own U.S. health systems are so interested in the lowest price, they don't build resilience criteria into the contracting. And so, this is a real mess. 
> 
> And something that's talked about a lot less is that on the device side, the very low cost devices, syringes, stop cocks, we're down to one syringe maker now in the U.S., it's all-- and PPE, you remember when there was all the upset about gowns and gloves and masks, that's all moved back to China now. 
> 
> So, we're working, uh, with Congress to try to get fixes to the system that would require resilience as part of the effort and bring back. 
> 
> We don't need it all manufactured in the U.S., but we need enough in the U.S. and so-called friend-shored that we're not susceptible to these lapses that occur, that create real hardship in problems in the clinical care community. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:45:01]
> 
> In the meanwhile we have a huge effort every day and we're doing it right now with regard to basic normal.
> 
> Who would have thought we wouldn't have enough normal saline and Ringer's lactate for the country?
> 
> They were already in shortage. And now this plant went down in Asheville, due the hurricane. 
> 
> So in the meanwhile, we try to fix it up without having access to the data we need, because that's been blocked.
> 
> But, you know, so far we're mostly getting by okay. But as you point out, I think it's a tremendous amount of hardship that could be averted.

## ASPR spokesperson on response to Marburg in Rwanda

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response spokesperson
- **Date:** received October 4, 2024

> As part of ASPR’s preparedness mission, the agency has invested approximately $365 million dollars into medical countermeasures - a vaccine and antibody treatment - for filoviruses, such as Marburg.
> 
> We have invested over $235 million into the development of Sabin’s ChAd3-based filovirus vaccines that target Marburg virus and Sudan ebolavirus.
> 
> Another $129 million has been invested into the development of Mapp Biopharmaceutical’s MBP-091 monoclonal antibody for treatment of infected individuals.
> 
> These investments, coupled with ASPR’s expertise, have advanced the two countermeasures through preclinical safety and efficacy and Phase I clinical trials.
> 
> Doses of the ChAd3-SUDV were shipped to Uganda in preparation for a ring vaccination study just prior to the end of the latest Sudan ebolavirus outbreak and both ChAd3-SUDV and ChAd3-MARV are currently in Phase 2 trials in Uganda and Kenya.
> 
> In partnership with the Rwanda Ministry of Health and international colleagues, ASPR has made an initial quantity of MBP-091 and ChAd3-MARV available in Rwanda to enable patient treatment and vaccination of contacts and healthcare workers.
> 
> Those investigational therapeutics and vaccines will be used under clinical trial protocols approved by Rwandan Regulatory and Ethics Authorities.

## HHS and USDA press briefing after California dairy worker bird flu cases

- **Source:** conference call
- **Attribution:** hosted by the Department of Health and Human Services
- **Date:** occurred October 4, 2024

> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:06:24]
> 
> Both individuals are dairy workers at two different dairy farms in California, both of which again are known to have cows that have tested positive. 
> 
> The state of California in conjunction with their local county health departments have been conducting active symptom monitoring of exposed workers on these farms. As a reminder, this is the process whereby individuals or farm owners report any symptoms, and then are followed up by public health officials at the state or the county level for things like testing, therapeutics, etc.
> 
> Health officials in California identified both of these cases through that process. Both individuals experienced mild symptoms, including conjunctivitis and neither reported respiratory symptoms. Neither individual was hospitalized. One individual reported that they thought that they might have had a fever. 
> 
> Both individuals were tested, offered antiviral treatment and are recovering. California is following up with potential close contacts. 
> 
> We are aware of household contacts who are also dairy workers and who have been contacted by county public health departments, or who will be contacted today. Thus, the public health investigation is very much underway at this time. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [00:17:46]
> 
> Serology is one tool public health leverages when we identify close contacts retrospectively, when they no longer have respiratory symptoms.
> 
> A flu serology test is done by drawing blood or sticking a patient's finger for a blood sample. 
> 
> Although some commercial laboratories can test for seasonal influenza A or B antibodies, there is rarely a clinical reason to conduct such testing.
> 
> Antibody tests for H5 are not commercially available. The CDC laboratory is an influenza WHO collaborating center and can perform serology testing of novel flu viruses in its BSL-3 labs. And we do this routinely. 
> 
> This test is not like other clinical serologies, which is a test a clinician would order for HIV or hepatitis B or C. It's a research test we use for surveillance that provides supportive evidence that someone was or was not infected with H5. 
> 
> Testing for an H5 antibody is more complex than the clinical serology that I listed above, requiring both the appropriate viruses needed to detect specific antibodies, and in many cases, high containment laboratories to perform the testing because the methods require working with infectious viruses. 
> 
> That means that it may take an additional two weeks for us to report the result of the seven serology specimens obtained from individuals in Missouri. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [00:19:10]
> 
> I will briefly walk you through the steps that CDC is taking to test these samples. 
> 
> As we previously reported, CDC was able to perform partial sequencing of the avian influenza H5 virus from the case in Missouri, despite a nearly undetectable level of viral RNA in the patient sample. 
> 
> This showed that the virus had two potentially important mutations, meaning two amino acid differences, in comparison with the virus is previously characterized during this event that could affectantigenicity.
> 
> Antigenicity is a property of being able to induce a specific immune response, such as creation of specific antibodies. So for serology testing, to be conclusive, it needs to be done using a virus that is genetically identical to the one obtained from the human case from Missouri or else there is a risk of a false negative test. 
> 
> Since this H5 virus was not recoverable, we could not grow it because there was not enough from the Missouri specimen, CDC needed to create the right virus for the test using reverse genetics to match the one from Missouri so that we can use it in these serology tests. 
> 
> This requires additional time and involves multiple steps. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [00:20:26]
> 
> So we've been working on this since we sequenced the virus from the Missouri patient in mid-September. 
> 
> It took about three weeks, to rescue the Missouri virus using reverse genetics, and complete the quality control steps that ensure we have the right virus.
> 
> This process will conclude by Monday and serology testing on the samples will begin.
> 
> At this point in time, CDC expects that conclusive serology testing results will be available in mid to late October. 
> 
> We realize people including all of us at CDC are anxious to see results from this testing. CDC is moving at a very accelerated pace while conducting rigorous science to assure the validity of these results.
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:22:59]
> 
> USDA has confirmed that the virus present in California is the B3.13 strain that was detected in the first three affected California premises and has been detected in dairy herds in other states. 
> 
> This is the same virus that we've been detecting in herd since the very beginning of the emergence of H5N1 in dairy cows back in March.
> 
> CDFA has been conducting a very thorough trace back, and the initial cluster of detections, that were noted, were found through this trace back activity.
> 
> Subsequently, CDFA has established a 10 kilometer zone around each of the affected dairies and begun testing bulk milk at the dairies in those zones, every week, for H5N1.
> 
> This bulk milk tank sampling has been the source of all of the recent detections that we've seen out of California. 
> 
> CDFA is also evaluating additional strategies for milk, collecting milk samples from unaffected areas that are not located in the surveillance zone, which may include utilizing state, federal regulatory animal health personnel, county, or state milk inspectors, or milk processors to give them a more comprehensive picture of the emergence of H5N1 in California. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:25:54]
> 
> As many of you may be aware, the state initiated a mandatory bulk milk testing program, in an effort to clear the virus from Colorado in July 2024, (inaudible) and it has proven to be very successful. 
> 
> The state's surveillance was in response to ongoing detections, in individual premise. Initially this revealed a significant local prevalence about 72% of dairies, centered in Weld county. 
> 
> Colorado has seen excellent compliance with the mandatory bulk milk testing. And right now we can report that there is only one positive herd, out of the state total of 86 herds that is currently affected by H5N1.
> 
> Mandatory surveillance in the state allows for continuous monitoring of herds and helps to detect any instances of non-negative results early on ensuring timely intervention. 
> 
> This decrease in the Colorado cases, even in the absence of a vaccine, gives us further confidence that H5N1 can be eliminated in the national herd, even in states where we have seen an initial rapid increase in cases. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Steve Grube, FDA [00:32:19]
> 
> Foremost, we wanted to address concerns from dairy producers that commercial milk processors might reject milk from dairy premises identified as having or possibly having H5N1 infections in their herds. 
> 
> We have received no reports that this has happened anywhere. But we wanted to emphasize that there's no reason for it to happen.
> 
> Left unaddressed, that concern could discourage robust participation in voluntary surveillance and sampling programs, which are critical to expand knowledge of the disease and inform programs to reduce H5N1 circulation. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [00:48:09] 
> 
> There have been extensive questionnaires that were conducted with this individual, and they included, sort of a review of food exposure. 
> 
> So again, no raw milk exposure. 
> 
> The individual did report using dairy and eating dairy, but we don't have anything that would implicate an immediate dairy exposure. 
> 
> Certainly not raw given the fact that they reported no raw milk exposure, but nothing that sort of directly implicates the dairy exposure at all.
> 
> Again, I think it's fair to say that we, despite a lot of work on Missouri's part, supported by us, in thorough investigation through survey, we have not been able to detect an animal or animal product exposure, based on that on those conversations.
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:55:19]
> 
> I actually don't think that it is out of place.
> 
> In those states that have had a really robust response and begun bulk milk testing very rapidly, I'd point to Colorado and Michigan in particular. 
> 
> We've seen a very rapid phase of initial detections, and a subsequent diminishment over time, sort of a long tail as the disease is eliminated from herds within the region. 
> 
> I think what we're doing now is seeing that very steep initial run up in detections caused by the state's very thorough testing program. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Steve Grube, FDA [00:56:32]
> 
> So as soon as we heard about this case, we worked with our state co-regulatory partners to identify any potential pasteurization failures in any state that supplied milk for Missouri and working with our partners, we found that there were no pasteurization failures in a recent timeframe, where it might be a reason for this person to be exposed. 
> 
> Again, there were no pasteurization failures in any states that were supplying dairy products to Missouri. 
> 
> And in addition, the amount of virus killed by pasteurization provides a many log order of magnitude safety barrier, safety margin, that ensures that the milk supply remains safe.

## CDC One Health webinar on H5N1 in cattle

- **Source:** webinar
- **Attribution:** hosted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
- **Date:** occurred October 2, 2024

> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:17:35]
> 
> We are wrapping up now the third round of experiments in BSL 3 facilities, in order to help us better understand how this disease manifests in animals, and how we can address it.
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:17:59]
> 
> I will mention that we are also sampling beef that is derived from culled dairy cows, through our national residue monitoring program, to make sure that we have as much visibility into H5N1 in the herd as possible. 
> 
> To date, we have detected no H5N1 in these samples, but out of an abundance of concern, both for public health, public safety, trading relationships and opportunities, we're going to continue to do this for the foreseeable future. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:18:41]
> 
> A couple of things that folks often are interested in is the way in which this disease has spread and whether or not say the fall migration and birds moving back through the environment pose a risk to dairy cattle in the same way that they do to avian flock, typically poultry houses. 
> 
> And the answer is no. We have quite definitive evidence that H5N1 is spreading between states through cattle movement, which I mentioned earlier, and then spread between dairies, and sometimes, within dairies and sometimes to other dairies through the movements of individuals and equipment. 
> 
> We don't know everything that we would like to about this disease, and we're continuing to study it as vigorously as we can. We're particularly interested at this point at the manner in which the disease is transmitted from individual cow to individual. We know that it is not respiratory. We do know that it is associated with milk. We believe that milking equipment, and other environmental surfaces or milking practices are implicated, but it is challenging to get the definitive answer that we want, even as we continue to explore that we do know the best way to address that. 
> 
> And that is to make sure that folks understand the risk to their herd, and are able to implement biosecurity, in order to mitigate the risk of the spread. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Lizette Durand, CDC [00:39:30]
> 
> CDC is also collaborating with state health departments on H5N1 seroprevalence studies to determine if there is asymptomatic infection among people who have worked with sick cows.
> 
> Sero prevalence studies can help to answer important public health questions about whether there is evidence of asymptomatic infections and what behaviors are associated with greater or lower risk to infection. 
> 
> The Michigan health department released negative results from first round of data collection last month, additional data collection is ongoing. 
> 
> Colorado has completed enrollment in their study, and CDC is testing specimens in our lab. 
> 
> Additionally, a CDC team of epidemiologists, veterinarians and health communications specialists worked with the Ohio department of health to conduct a serosurvey that will assess past exposures to H5 viruses among a national network of veterinarians and other veterinary professionals. Next slide, please. 
> 
> As I mentioned on the previous slide, CDC collaborated with the Ohio department of health at the American Association of Bovine Practitioners or AABP annual conference to conduct a sero survey. 
> 
> The study enroll at about 150 attendees who have worked closely with cattle in the past three months.

## FDA spokesperson on OMOR sunscreen submission 

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Food and Drug Administration spokesperson Cherie Duvall-Jones
- **Date:** received October 2, 2024

> As DSM has publicly indicated, it has submitted an OMOR for bemotrizinol to the FDA. In general, after an OTC Monograph Order Request (OMOR) is submitted, the FDA will determine if the OMOR is acceptable for filing. If the FDA accepts the OMOR for filing, the FDA will review the OMOR. The FDA would then typically issue a proposed order addressing the substance of the OMOR within a timeframe agreed to under the OMUFA Goals Document. The public will have a minimum of 45 calendar days to submit comments on the proposed order (although FDA may provide for a longer comment period). After reviewing and considering the comments, the FDA would issue a final order, including to update the relevant OTC monograph(s), if appropriate. 
> 
> The FDA continues to encourage industry to submit data to address the data gaps for those monograph ingredients FDA has indicated need additional data. This will enable the FDA to confirm the ‘generally recognized as safe and effective’ status of these ingredients.
