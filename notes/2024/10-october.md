> As DSM has publicly indicated, it has submitted an OMOR for bemotrizinol to the FDA. In general, after an OTC Monograph Order Request (OMOR) is submitted, the FDA will determine if the OMOR is acceptable for filing. If the FDA accepts the OMOR for filing, the FDA will review the OMOR. The FDA would then typically issue a proposed order addressing the substance of the OMOR within a timeframe agreed to under the OMUFA Goals Document. The public will have a minimum of 45 calendar days to submit comments on the proposed order (although FDA may provide for a longer comment period). After reviewing and considering the comments, the FDA would issue a final order, including to update the relevant OTC monograph(s), if appropriate. 
> 
> The FDA continues to encourage industry to submit data to address the data gaps for those monograph ingredients FDA has indicated need additional data. This will enable the FDA to confirm the ‘generally recognized as safe and effective’ status of these ingredients.
