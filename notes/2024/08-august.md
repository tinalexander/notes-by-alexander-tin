## FDA spokesperson on shortage of tirzepatide and compounding

- **Date:** received August 5, 2024

> The FDA continues to actively monitor drug availability and work with the company to confirm the supply is stable and help ensure patient access to safe, effective drugs. The FDA is currently working to determine if the available supply of tirzepatide would meet our definition of a Resolved Shortage.
> 
> The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines a drug shortage as a period of time when the demand or projected demand for the drug within the United States exceeds the supply of the drug. FDA tracks shortages at the national level and receives information from manufacturers about their ability to supply the market. We consider a drug to be in shortage when the total supply of all versions of a commercially available product cannot meet the current demand, and a registered alternative manufacturer will not meet the current and/or projected demands for the potentially medically necessary use(s) at the patient level.
> 
> The Drug Shortages Database lists product information as it is given to FDA by the manufacturers. This information can be helpful to pharmacies and other bulk purchasers when trying to source specific products, strengths, or vial sizes during a shortage. Although all dosages of a drug may currently be listed as available, the criteria for moving a drug off the Drug Shortages list must still be met. FDA will move a drug in shortage from Current Shortage status to a Resolved status when all the manufacturers are able to meet total national historical demand and the FDA will verify with each firm that they have built enough safety stock prior to resolving each shortage.
> 
> Additionally, FDA generally considers a shortage to be resolved and removes the product from the Current Shortage section of the list based on an evaluation of the entire market, assessing whether all backorders have been filled and supply is meeting or exceeding demand. In making this evaluation, FDA may consider, among other factors, affected market share, ability of alternate manufacturers to cover the demand, and confirmed market stabilization.
> 
> The FDA cannot provide a general timeline for when a drug may come off the shortage list because each drug shortage is assessed on a case-by-case basis. We work closely with the manufacturers throughout the duration of a shortage and will verify their ability to meet the national demand, as well as whether they have built enough safety stock, before considering it resolved.
> 
> ...
> 
> Federal law addresses compounding by a licensed pharmacist in a state-licensed pharmacy, federal facility, or by a physician (503A), as well as compounding by or under the direct supervision of a licensed pharmacist in an outsourcing facility (503B). A drug may be compounded for a patient when an FDA approved drug is not medically appropriate to treat them. In these situations, compounding can serve an important patient need. Generally, when an FDA approved drug is in shortage, compounders may prepare a compounded form it if they meet certain requirements in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act.
> 
> Section 503A of the FD&C Act restricts compounded drugs that are essentially copies of commercially available, but certain amounts are permissible under the law as long as the compounding is not done "regularly or in inordinate amounts." When an FDA approved drug is on the shortage list, it is not considered to be commercially available. All other conditions of section 503A would have to be met, including compounding pursuant to a valid prescription for an identified patient.
> 
> Outsourcing facilities operating under section 503B of the FD&C Act are generally prohibited from making essentially a copy of an FDA approved drug. However, this limitation is lifted in certain instances, such as when an FDA-approved drug appears on the FDA Drug Shortage list. In that case, an outsourcing facility can use a bulk drug substance, also known as an API, to make a drug product that is essentially a copy of what is on the FDA drug shortage page.

> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:07:34]
> 
> So these bars show dengue incidence in Puerto Rico over this year. 
> 
> And as you can see, since about the third week of this year, we've been above the epidemic threshold. 
> 
> And generally when this sorts of things happen, it often portends a large outbreak as we get into the peak transmission season.
> 
> Time will tell what will happen. 
> 
> So, we've had about 1900 or 1800 dengue cases reported in Puerto Rico. This is actually a drop in the bucket. 
> 
> We mainly get reports from hospitalized cases, about 60% of these people have been hospitalized. 
> 
> The true number of dengue cases is undoubtedly much larger.
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:08:53]
> 
> So you can see what's happened in 2022, 2023 and 2019 in the lighter colored lines. Generally travel associated cases. 
> 
> We do expect to start to increase as dengue starts increasing in the Northern hemisphere. 
> 
> Most of this giant increase you saw was happening in the Southern hemisphere, as they were in the summer now going into the winter, but now we're going into our summer peak transmission season. 
> 
> So in 2024, we've had triple the number of travel associate cases, generally at a time when incidence of travel associated cases are low. 
> 
> But that number has slowly gone down over time, just because of the Southern hemisphere is now going into winter, but we do expect this number to start to increase markedly as the Northern hemisphere starts to get more affected by dengue.
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:10:18]
> 
> What I want to do now is talk about the response to dengue cases in non-endemic areas. 
> 
> Now, this is a guidance document that we are in the process of creating. It is almost done. But there's a few tweaks that need to happen. 
> 
> But in the meantime, I want to show you basically what this is going to be all about. 
> 
> So this document will have, talk about three different areas. 
> 
> How do you in investigate suspected dengue cases? 
> 
> What happens if you have travel associated dengue cases in your area?
> 
> And what happens if local transmission occurs in your area?
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:13:30]
> 
> So the next would be how do you respond in travel associated cases? 
> 
> So there's three things that we consider. 
> 
> One is our Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus present in the area, particularly Aedes aegypti, since that's a much more efficient transmitter than Aedes albopictus.
> 
> The second, are you in an area that's likely to experience or possibly going experience a local transmission? 
> 
> And so what we've decide kind of arbitrarily defined this is have travel associated dengue cases been regularly reported in your area, or has local dengue transmission occurred in the past in the area?
> 
> And this would be primarily places, mainly places in south Florida or southern Texas, but also elsewhere to a lesser  probability. 
> 
> And the other thing is what is the probability of dengue transmission in your area?
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:19:41]
> 
> So areas with a moderate probability of dengue transmission, one is to inform healthcare providers to consider testing for dengue in patients with compatible symptoms, after excluding more common causes of febrile illness.
> 
> This is probably the most difficult part of this guidance because of, obviously, that dengue, many of the symptoms of dengue kind of overlap with a lot of other things that are not dengue. 
> 
> And so trying to figure out exactly when to test for dengue and when to not test for dengue is a little bit difficult. 
> 
> So we're-- that's one of the areas that we're still working on, on the guidance, when exactly would we recommend testing for dengue? 
> 
> I mean, in a person who basically maybe hasn't traveled, so that's one issue that's complicated.
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:22:57]
> 
> If you do have local transmission, you might want to think about increasing surveillance, offering dengue testing and gathering information on recent febrile illness for other household members in particular, and strongly consider enhanced surveillance around the home, particularly if the source of dengue introduction is unknown. 
> 
> So you can also go door to door trying to identify additional cases, which can help. 
> 
> And also testing Aedes aegypti mosquitoes for dengue infection using RTPCR. 
> 
> We get a lot of questions about whether you should do mosquito surveillance around for dengue around local transmission cases.
> 
> It's an adjunct to looking for human cases and it's also pretty labor intensive. And the more traps you put out, the more likely you are to find it, but it's not a particularly sensitive way of finding dengue transmission in area. 
> 
> But if you do find it, it clearly confirms that there is local transmission risk ongoing.
> 
> Healthcare provider outreach is important. 
> 
> If you do find local transmission in your area, certainly you want to warn healthcare workers because we want people to get properly diagnosed and treated, and to be for healthcare workers to look out for it, because they don't-- dengue is clearly not going to be first on their mind when they see a patient in the ED or elsewhere. 
> 
> And also consider testing for dengue and people with compatible symptoms. 
> 
> Also reporting is key. We want to know where these cases are important for both the state and local health department, as well as us and to monitor the situation nationally.
> 
> And continuing mosquito control educational campaigns as well.
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:25:36]
> 
> So how can you help?
> 
> Continuing to raise awareness about the increasing risk of dengue, particularly among travelers, thinking about local transmission and certainly we're coming into the peak transmission season for dengue. 
> 
> So being alert is critical, and also making sure that clinicians are trying to get clinicians to order FDA approved diagnostic testing for dengue.
