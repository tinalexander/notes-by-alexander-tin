> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:07:34]
> 
> So these bars show dengue incidence in Puerto Rico over this year. 
> 
> And as you can see, since about the third week of this year, we've been above the epidemic threshold. 
> 
> And generally when this sorts of things happen, it often portends a large outbreak as we get into the peak transmission season.
> 
> Time will tell what will happen. 
> 
> So, we've had about 1900 or 1800 dengue cases reported in Puerto Rico. This is actually a drop in the bucket. 
> 
> We mainly get reports from hospitalized cases, about 60% of these people have been hospitalized. 
> 
> The true number of dengue cases is undoubtedly much larger.
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:08:53]
> 
> So you can see what's happened in 2022, 2023 and 2019 in the lighter colored lines. Generally travel associated cases. 
> 
> We do expect to start to increase as dengue starts increasing in the Northern hemisphere. 
> 
> Most of this giant increase you saw was happening in the Southern hemisphere, as they were in the summer now going into the winter, but now we're going into our summer peak transmission season. 
> 
> So in 2024, we've had triple the number of travel associate cases, generally at a time when incidence of travel associated cases are low. 
> 
> But that number has slowly gone down over time, just because of the Southern hemisphere is now going into winter, but we do expect this number to start to increase markedly as the Northern hemisphere starts to get more affected by dengue.
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:10:18]
> 
> What I want to do now is talk about the response to dengue cases in non-endemic areas. 
> 
> Now, this is a guidance document that we are in the process of creating. It is almost done. But there's a few tweaks that need to happen. 
> 
> But in the meantime, I want to show you basically what this is going to be all about. 
> 
> So this document will have, talk about three different areas. 
> 
> How do you in investigate suspected dengue cases? 
> 
> What happens if you have travel associated dengue cases in your area?
> 
> And what happens if local transmission occurs in your area?
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:13:30]
> 
> So the next would be how do you respond in travel associated cases? 
> 
> So there's three things that we consider. 
> 
> One is our Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus present in the area, particularly Aedes aegypti, since that's a much more efficient transmitter than Aedes albopictus.
> 
> The second, are you in an area that's likely to experience or possibly going experience a local transmission? 
> 
> And so what we've decide kind of arbitrarily defined this is have travel associated dengue cases been regularly reported in your area, or has local dengue transmission occurred in the past in the area?
> 
> And this would be primarily places, mainly places in south Florida or southern Texas, but also elsewhere to a lesser  probability. 
> 
> And the other thing is what is the probability of dengue transmission in your area?
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:19:41]
> 
> So areas with a moderate probability of dengue transmission, one is to inform healthcare providers to consider testing for dengue in patients with compatible symptoms, after excluding more common causes of febrile illness.
> 
> This is probably the most difficult part of this guidance because of, obviously, that dengue, many of the symptoms of dengue kind of overlap with a lot of other things that are not dengue. 
> 
> And so trying to figure out exactly when to test for dengue and when to not test for dengue is a little bit difficult. 
> 
> So we're-- that's one of the areas that we're still working on, on the guidance, when exactly would we recommend testing for dengue? 
> 
> I mean, in a person who basically maybe hasn't traveled, so that's one issue that's complicated.
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:22:57]
> 
> If you do have local transmission, you might want to think about increasing surveillance, offering dengue testing and gathering information on recent febrile illness for other household members in particular, and strongly consider enhanced surveillance around the home, particularly if the source of dengue introduction is unknown. 
> 
> So you can also go door to door trying to identify additional cases, which can help. 
> 
> And also testing Aedes aegypti mosquitoes for dengue infection using RTPCR. 
> 
> We get a lot of questions about whether you should do mosquito surveillance around for dengue around local transmission cases.
> 
> It's an adjunct to looking for human cases and it's also pretty labor intensive. And the more traps you put out, the more likely you are to find it, but it's not a particularly sensitive way of finding dengue transmission in area. 
> 
> But if you do find it, it clearly confirms that there is local transmission risk ongoing.
> 
> Healthcare provider outreach is important. 
> 
> If you do find local transmission in your area, certainly you want to warn healthcare workers because we want people to get properly diagnosed and treated, and to be for healthcare workers to look out for it, because they don't-- dengue is clearly not going to be first on their mind when they see a patient in the ED or elsewhere. 
> 
> And also consider testing for dengue and people with compatible symptoms. 
> 
> Also reporting is key. We want to know where these cases are important for both the state and local health department, as well as us and to monitor the situation nationally.
> 
> And continuing mosquito control educational campaigns as well.
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:25:36]
> 
> So how can you help?
> 
> Continuing to raise awareness about the increasing risk of dengue, particularly among travelers, thinking about local transmission and certainly we're coming into the peak transmission season for dengue. 
> 
> So being alert is critical, and also making sure that clinicians are trying to get clinicians to order FDA approved diagnostic testing for dengue.
