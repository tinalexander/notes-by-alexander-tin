- **Date:** received August 7, 2024

> Indeed, the U.S. has made an offer of 50,000 doses of MVA-BN vaccines to the DRC. In addition to this, Bavarian-Nordic, the vaccine manufacturer, has also made an offer of 15,000 MVA-BN doses.
>  
> The government of the DRC is still in discussion with the governments of Japan and other Member States on vaccine donation, and updates on these shall be shared once these discussions are concluded.
>  
> Lastly, the vaccine doses already offered are not yet in the DRC, but work to get them there is already underway.

## WHO officials on mpox clade Ib outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo

> Rosamund Lewis, WHO [00:15:11]
> 
> Indeed, clade Ib has demonstrated some mutations, one of which you have mentioned, which suggests that the virus has been circulating explosively person to person, which is indeed what the evidence that is available as this particular--
> 
> These provinces and countries have not reported mpox before September of last year, in the case of south Kivu, earlier this year, in the case of north Kivu and just in the last few weeks, month, in the case of the, for eastern neighboring countries. 
> 
> So it is a virus that is transmitting explosively person to person, as far as we know. 
> 
> In addition to that, the virus has shown other mutations, which make it necessary to ensure that the correct laboratory protocol is in place to make sure that the clade can be discerned, if PCR is what is being used. 
> 
> PCR is the standard for laboratory diagnostics, and there are different protocols. And so WHO has some weeks ago put out new laboratory guidance on the protocols recommended by WHO for detection of this particular strain. So the countries are in a position to detect the strain that is -- that support is being provided, through the response of WHO with the support of the countries in support to the countries.
> 
> At the moment, there is no specific information that suggests that the virus, the clade Ib is more transmissible per se. 
> 
> It is transmitting through sexual networks, interlinked sexual networks. And we know from the global outbreak that transmission through sexual networks occurs more rapidly. 
> 
> It doesn't necessarily mean that the virus itself is more transmissible. However, as the virus does continue to spread, it is also spreading within families and through community contacts, through the other modes of transmission, which we are familiar with, which is direct physical contact, face to face contact, which may involve exchange of respiratory droplets, and of course, what we call fomites, which are things such as beddings and towels, which may be contaminated sharing a bed, for example, in a family setting would also be a high risk environment if someone in that family has mpox. 
> 
> So the virus is a new strain. It has been now confirmed and documented by scientists, a number of scientists by countries and by WHO, and these are the features that we are aware of so far of this particular new strain.
> 
> As to whether it is more severe, so we've talked about transmissibility, which we don't know that it's more transmissible, but it is transmitting through an efficient mode of transmission. 
> 
> And as to whether it is more severe, we also don't know.
> 
> It is definitely causing severe disease, and it is definitely causing some deaths, but most of the persons affected so far have been adults. And as you know, children are more vulnerable. 
> 
> So it is still difficult to say whether this particular strain is less or more severe than the standard clade I, if you will. So that is something that we are definitely looking out for at the moment. 
> 
> It seems to not be more severe than the standard clade I, but it's dependent on many factors on context in which it is currently circulating. 
> 
> So these two features are things that we don't yet have full information on, which is transmissibility and virulence .
> 
> ...
> 
> Rosamund Lewis, WHO [00:25:18]
> 
> This virus is spreading through sexual transmission and through sexual networks. 
> 
> The DRC, Democratic Republic of the Congo, has good data on the cadres of individuals, if you will, in terms of their profession that are being affected by this. 
> 
> And whereas there was one third of cases in the beginning of the outbreak were among sex workers, that proportion is now reducing as more people are being affected in the community. 
> 
> This includes, students, businessmen, people traveling across the borders for different reasons, and those whose whose occupation is not reported. 
> 
> So we do know that this is transmitting through sexual networks, and we do know that this includes sex workers, which obviously, there are commercial sex activities in the region, which include those necessary for survival for income generation. 
> 
> And so everything that, Dr Van Kerkhove has said about risk communication, community engagement, and increasing access to vaccines, all remains critical for this outbreak response. 
> 
> Some children have been affected already. At the moment that proportion is not very great. 
> 
> But there are cases in areas such as displaced internally displaced persons camps, as well as congregate settings. 
> 
> So it's a complex outbreak with myriad manifestations and the response has to be contextualized, localized, to identify those at risk, and provide the information and resources they need to respond to this outbreak.
> 
> ...
> 
> Deusdedit Mubangizi, WHO [00:28:43]
> 
> Now that the director general has launched the emergency use listing, we will be reaching out to the manufacturers and the applicants to submit applications for evaluation and the emergency use listing team has already been put in place already to review these applications. 
> 
> And we-- they will be screened within one week and the assessment should not take more than one week from acceptance, more than one month from acceptance into assessment. 
> 
> And thereafter, we shall convene the taking technical advisory group, or the TAG as we refer to it, within one week of the report being available. And the, the TAG will make a recommendation. 
> 
> Now, should that recommendation of the vaccine be positive, WHO is ready to share the assessment reports with member states to facilitate their authorization and acceptance into countries so that then they can be available for use.
> 
> Just to supplement what Maria and others have said, when these vaccines are available, we urge all clinicians, member states that are using them to continue gathering information so that we can actually gather all the information that is needed about the use of these vaccines. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Rosamund Lewis, WHO [00:33:55]
> 
> Two countries in the African region have already approved mpox vaccines for emergency use. 
> 
> That is Nigeria has approved the use of one vaccine, MVA-BN, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo has approved the emergency use of LC-16 vaccine and MVA-BN. 
> 
> This is just to note that those countries have moved ahead with their planning on securing vaccines and the discussions are underway to make that happen.
> 
> That will not in any way impede the process of the emergency listing, which is necessary, as multiple countries are now reporting cases at the same time. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Rosamund Lewis, WHO [00:35:38]
> 
> Risk is risk. WHO does have a method of assessing risk, which can be low, moderate, high, or very high. 
> 
> And, at the moment, the risk of further spread in the region is moderate for the general population high in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
> 
> And we are reviewing the risk assessment now to bring it up to date with the latest information. And so that will be made available, shortly in, in new communications. 
> 
> Having said that, we've already seen that the virus is now rapidly been documented in four new countries that had never reported before. And we've also seen what can happen in the global outbreak that began in 2022, where many countries were affected in a very short period of time. 
> 
> So, we can't predict for sure what will happen, but we can anticipate that there are different scenarios and need to be prepared for that risk, and for further spread, in the event that that does occur, which can occur, either in proximity to countries that already have the virus, or of course at further distance, through other modes of travel, whether it be road travel or rail travel, air travel, or foot travel. 
> 
> So all those modes of travel can of course continue to contribute to the outbreak. 
> 
> We just want to be also very clear that the standing recommendations that have been in place since August of 2023 do not recommend specific travel measures. 
> 
> What is recommended is information to travelers and cross-border collaboration between countries on surveillance and on case management.
> 
> Other specific travel measures, such as shutting down travel mechanisms or things like that are not being recommended at this time.
> 
> They have not been recommended since the beginning of the global outbreak. What we are looking for is supporting countries to support each other through cross-border work, which is necessary to stem the continuing spread of the outbreak.
> 
> ...
> 
> Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO [00:37:47]
> 
> I just want to highlight the urgency that we are trying to get across today, right? 
> 
> There's a lot of things that are happening with mpox. This is an outbreak that caused a global outbreak. We had a public emergency of international concern. There was some attention to this, that attention waned. 
> 
> There's an ongoing outbreak that's happening. We're talking about spread. 
> 
> This virus is being detected, particularly this clade Ib, which we know is more severe than clade II, is being detected in a number of additional countries. 
> 
> There are certainly increased awareness. There's increased readiness in countries, which is excellent, and there is increased reporting, but this is detecting circulation. And this is something we wanna act upon now.
> 
> All of the things that can be done and reiterate what Mike said, what Dr. Tedros has said, that this can be stopped, if we actually put a concerted effort into this.
> 
> We don't sit here and watch and wait. And we do not want the world to sit and watch and wait until whatever that until is to actually trigger some action. 
> 
> The time is now, the time was before, but let's talk where we are actually today and actually make the investment in mpox that is causing significant challenges in many of the countries across the African region. 
> 
> This is a-- we are living in an interconnected world and these pathogens do not respect borders. 
> 
> So I just want to get across the urgency that we're trying to say that the action is now, the time is now for us to take much more measures and provide much more support to the African region, to the countries that are affected across the entire spectrum from surveillance, to prevention, to risk communication, to clinical care, to infection prevention control, to R&D, to the use of vaccines. It's now.
> 
> ...
> 
> Rosamund Lewis, WHO [00:52:48]
> 
> We have good data insofar as we are able to secure that data for reported clinically compatible cases, versus confirmed laboratory confirmed cases. 
> 
> So overall the case fatality ratio of reported cases of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is currently 3.6% that is across all provinces and across all age groups. 
> 
> We do know that in endemic areas, which is the central north and west of the country, that the case fatality ratio is significantly higher than in the east at the moment. 
> 
> It is higher partly because many more children are affected. So three quarters of the cases are among children and 88% of the deaths are among children under 15 as well. And there's an age gradient in the case fatality ratio. 
> 
> So infants have a high case fatality ratio of over 5%, children under five, have a case fatality ratio, which is a bit lower, under 15 lower still. We have all this data online that you can also look for that there, we can provide that link. 
> 
> And in adults or children and adults over 15, the case fatality ratio is lower than 3%. So we do have that information.
> 
> In the eastern part of the country where it is clade Ib, the case fatality ratio at the moment, is just under 1%. And it remains lower than the other part of the country.
> 
> As I said earlier, we don't know yet if this is because the clade is perhaps less severe as opposed to more severe in terms of clade Ib versus clade I.
> 
> But it's also because it's almost exclusively, at the moment, most cases are among adults. So we don't have that demographic of children under 15, under five, and infants currently affected to the same extent. And therefore we don't have the same number of cases leading to deaths because those are the most vulnerable groups. 
> 
> However, there are also women who are pregnant, who have been reported to have mpox, that has led to death of the mother in rare cases, and also loss of the pregnancy in other cases. 
> 
> So there are a number of significant medical, clinical, and public health impacts that can arise as the virus continues to spread. 
> 
> At the moment, just to summarize, the case fatality ratio overall in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is around 3.6%, higher in endemic areas. And especially in infants in young children, and lower in the eastern part of the country at the moment where spread is more rapid through sexual transmission among adults.

## CDC officials at AMA webinar on fall and winter respiratory virus season

> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:09:13]
> 
> What about timing? 
> 
> We are going to see an updated COVID 19 and flu vaccine, here in just a few weeks.
> 
> Flu is actually starting to be available right now. So you can be ordering that, be getting that in to your practice already. 
> 
> The COVID 19 vaccine should be available within the next number of weeks, maybe the end of August, beginning of September, but right now is a great time to pre-order. 
> 
> And we'll have more on that that soon. And then the administration should continue through September, October, November. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:10:36]
> 
> So COVID vaccine available soon, then start giving those September, October, November.
> 
> Flu, already starting to be available. We want to ideally administer in the September, October timeframe.
> 
> RSV can be doing now or late summer, early fall. 
> 
> And then again, the infant and maternal, a little closer to the start of RSV season, in the more, in the late September, October timeframe here. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:20:01]
> 
> The last thing I wanted to bring up for you is as a campaign that you may see us running in your neck of the woods, we are going to be able to run some paid advertisement during the season to help folks get ready and then actually motivate to action to get vaccinated. 
> 
> It's a campaign called Risk Less, Do More, Get This Season's Vaccines. 
> 
> So,you are going to see some of that launch in a few weeks here. Obviously it's not time yet to get those COVID and flu vaccines. So you're going to see more of that campaign launched in a bit, but we'll start with focusing on RSV because, if someone comes in who's over 75 right now, they can get that one dose of the RSV vaccine and they're set into the future. 
> 
> We are going to be working through some paid media, including TV, radio, and print. So maybe you'll see this in your neck of the woods. 
> 
> The audiences on the next slide that we're focused on are not going to be surprising.
> 
> Who are the folks that are at highest risk and need to risk left to do more? It's older adults and folks in long-term care facilities, or our nursing home residents. We want to be making sure we're really targeting that highest risk group. 
> 
> So you'll see a lot of images like the one on the screen where we are making sure to have messages to our older adults and particularly those who are in long-term care facilities.
> 
> That all being said, we also want to make sure that we are recognizing that historically marginalized communities continue to see lower vaccination rates than others. 
> 
> And we make part of this campaign will be to reach out to all adult populations, specifically focusing on our Black, Latino, and rural audiences. 
> 
> And then lastly, we have a component that will be focused on you all, because we know how important a team member our clinical community is in making sure vaccination happens. 
> 
> So we're going to have some ability to do messaging. So you may see some ads and such again, reiterating a lot of what we are covering today.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:22:10]
> 
> Just a reminder that we've been talking about fall and winter, but we are having a fair amount of COVID circulating right now. 
> 
> And just a reminder that we have tools for you to know what's happening in your community. What is, how many folks are getting admitted to the emergency room based on COVID, what are, what is, are things looking like, so that you know how to potentially change or recommend things particularly for those higher risk patients. 
> 
> So just know that that COVID is circulating right now. 
> 
> What we are seeing is while there is a fair amount of COVID circulating, we're seeing lower levels of emergency rooms and hospitalizations than we've seen in the past, which is good. 
> 
> But we want to make sure we're continuing to protect each other, particularly those folks who are at highest risk. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:25:30]
> 
> So one of the ways in which we try to understand, get a little bit of a sense of what's going to happen for our flu season or our overall respiratory season is to look at the southern hemisphere where flu is circulating right now.
> 
> And what we, again, it's never a perfect marker, but what we are seeing, it's a pretty typical season, meaning it didn't start too early, they're seeing what is a pretty typical season. 
> 
> So not better, not worse, but pretty typical, didn't start early. So again, we're anticipating a typical start, which means later in the October timeframe.
> 
> However, coming out of the COVID pandemic, we are still recalibrating what these, the start times of these seasons are. So we want to be prepared now. That's why we're here at the beginning of August, having this conversation to get ready, get prepared as we get into the season.
> 
> We have the power in our own hands to know how bad of a season it's going to be, right? The more protection we get out there, the more mild the season can be.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:35:15]
> 
> For the vast majority of primary care docs, the risk in your patient population is extremely low. 
> 
> If you happen to work with folks who work on farms or have come into contact with cows or with poultry, you definitely want to have that as a heightened thing that you are looking for, but the-- we have not seen a case of human to human spread of avian flu. And that is good news, but we are taking this very seriously. 
> 
> We do know that farm workers are at risk and those who are exposed to the avian virus directly, but the larger population, the risk is very low. 
> 
> That all being said, I think it makes it even more important that we focus on getting folks the seasonal flu vaccine this year. 
> 
> We want to make sure folks have as much flu coverage as we can, right. To protect folks against the known thing that is spreading human to human, and that is seasonal flu. 
> 
> But we are working very hard to make sure we are protecting workers, that there is testing available. 
> 
> We-- it is a very different circumstance with avian flu than for COVID. 
> 
> For example, avian flu is something we have known about and been studying and preparing for, for decades. 
> 
> We have tests, we have treatment that is Tamiflu, and we even have vaccine candidates. 
> 
> So if we would see any escalation in what is presenting right now, we could also think about a vaccination campaign for farm workers, already, we have that available. 
> 
> So we have a lot of tools at our disposal, but for general folks in primary care, if you're not working with the farm community, that is unlikely to be something that you are seeing. 
> 
> But I do think it puts a bigger emphasis on us wanting to get both seasonal vaccinations for folks as well as our farm worker community,
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:38:58]
> 
> So we've been talking about everything we do can do to prepare, but once we're in the season, and once we think that there's a lot of virus circulating there, we we've all learned through the pandemic about a lot of different tools that can help us, to make sure that we are reducing our risk of getting those viruses circulating. 
> 
> So, as you may know, we redid our guidance on this back in the spring. So at the end of the winter season, we looked at our data and said, and simplified our guidance on this. 
> 
> And we also simplified it to focus on the thing that we know saves the most lives and that's vaccination. That's why we spent 90% of our time on this webinar talking about vaccination. It's what works at what keeps people out of the hospital. It's what saves lives.
> 
> But there are other ways we can also do things to protect ourselves. 
> 
> One is stay home when you're sick, right. And I-- which I know is hard, to miss that family party or that thing, that work event, but keep your germs to yourself and stay home when you're sick. 
> 
> But if you are out, doing things like hand sanitizing, wearing a mask, being, opening windows, improving ventilation, all of those are layers of protection, particularly if you were at higher risk or you are going to be around people who are at higher risk, you want to layer those things on top. 
> 
> So vaccination as a foundation, staying home, if you're sick, as a foundation, but then being outside, wearing a mask, using hand sanitizer, right? All of these things add layers of protection beyond that foundation. 
> 
> And this is the same guidance between COVID, flu or RSV, it's across any of these viruses. 
> 
> We did have specific guidance for quite some time around COVID because COVID was something new to us as humans. We hadn't had previous immunity to it.
> 
> Now that most of us have either had COVID, been vaccinated, we are in a-- we are different. 
> 
> The virus is still pretty, pretty transmissible. We're seeing right now in, in the summer, but we are different. And that is good. 
> 
> Meaning it is overall less severe than it was when we were first seeing the virus introduced to our communities. 
> 
> But it doesn't mean it's gone. And so we do have to remain vigilant again, vaccination, vaccination, still the best tool here to protect lives, as we go into the season.

## HHS spokesperson on new uninsured rate figures

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Health and Human Services spokesperson
- **Date:** received August 6, 2024

> “The Biden-Harris Administrations is committed to making sure Americans have access to affordable, quality health care. We are using every tool at our disposal to protect and strengthen access to coverage so individuals and families can maintain access to the health care they need. Since 2021, we have seen a historic number of Americans get health care including a record-breaking 21.4 million people who signed up for coverage through the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces. This is a direct result of the Biden-Harris Administration’s health care policies, such as lowering health insurance premiums by an average of $800 for millions of Americans and expanding Medicaid. We have more work to do to lower health care costs, including by permanently extending enhanced premium tax credits and expanding Medicaid in every state to get more people affordable, quality health care coverage.”

## FDA spokesperson on shortage of tirzepatide and compounding

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Food and Drug Administration spokesperson Amanda Hils
- **Date:** received August 5, 2024

> The FDA continues to actively monitor drug availability and work with the company to confirm the supply is stable and help ensure patient access to safe, effective drugs. The FDA is currently working to determine if the available supply of tirzepatide would meet our definition of a Resolved Shortage.
> 
> The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines a drug shortage as a period of time when the demand or projected demand for the drug within the United States exceeds the supply of the drug. FDA tracks shortages at the national level and receives information from manufacturers about their ability to supply the market. We consider a drug to be in shortage when the total supply of all versions of a commercially available product cannot meet the current demand, and a registered alternative manufacturer will not meet the current and/or projected demands for the potentially medically necessary use(s) at the patient level.
> 
> The Drug Shortages Database lists product information as it is given to FDA by the manufacturers. This information can be helpful to pharmacies and other bulk purchasers when trying to source specific products, strengths, or vial sizes during a shortage. Although all dosages of a drug may currently be listed as available, the criteria for moving a drug off the Drug Shortages list must still be met. FDA will move a drug in shortage from Current Shortage status to a Resolved status when all the manufacturers are able to meet total national historical demand and the FDA will verify with each firm that they have built enough safety stock prior to resolving each shortage.
> 
> Additionally, FDA generally considers a shortage to be resolved and removes the product from the Current Shortage section of the list based on an evaluation of the entire market, assessing whether all backorders have been filled and supply is meeting or exceeding demand. In making this evaluation, FDA may consider, among other factors, affected market share, ability of alternate manufacturers to cover the demand, and confirmed market stabilization.
> 
> The FDA cannot provide a general timeline for when a drug may come off the shortage list because each drug shortage is assessed on a case-by-case basis. We work closely with the manufacturers throughout the duration of a shortage and will verify their ability to meet the national demand, as well as whether they have built enough safety stock, before considering it resolved.
> 
> ...
> 
> Federal law addresses compounding by a licensed pharmacist in a state-licensed pharmacy, federal facility, or by a physician (503A), as well as compounding by or under the direct supervision of a licensed pharmacist in an outsourcing facility (503B). A drug may be compounded for a patient when an FDA approved drug is not medically appropriate to treat them. In these situations, compounding can serve an important patient need. Generally, when an FDA approved drug is in shortage, compounders may prepare a compounded form it if they meet certain requirements in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act.
> 
> Section 503A of the FD&C Act restricts compounded drugs that are essentially copies of commercially available, but certain amounts are permissible under the law as long as the compounding is not done "regularly or in inordinate amounts." When an FDA approved drug is on the shortage list, it is not considered to be commercially available. All other conditions of section 503A would have to be met, including compounding pursuant to a valid prescription for an identified patient.
> 
> Outsourcing facilities operating under section 503B of the FD&C Act are generally prohibited from making essentially a copy of an FDA approved drug. However, this limitation is lifted in certain instances, such as when an FDA-approved drug appears on the FDA Drug Shortage list. In that case, an outsourcing facility can use a bulk drug substance, also known as an API, to make a drug product that is essentially a copy of what is on the FDA drug shortage page.

## CDC official at NACCHO webinar on dengue

- **Source:** webinar
- **Attribution:** hosted by the National Association of County and City Health Officials
- **Date:** occurred on July 29, 2024

> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:07:34]
> 
> So these bars show dengue incidence in Puerto Rico over this year. 
> 
> And as you can see, since about the third week of this year, we've been above the epidemic threshold. 
> 
> And generally when this sorts of things happen, it often portends a large outbreak as we get into the peak transmission season.
> 
> Time will tell what will happen. 
> 
> So, we've had about 1900 or 1800 dengue cases reported in Puerto Rico. This is actually a drop in the bucket. 
> 
> We mainly get reports from hospitalized cases, about 60% of these people have been hospitalized. 
> 
> The true number of dengue cases is undoubtedly much larger.
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:08:53]
> 
> So you can see what's happened in 2022, 2023 and 2019 in the lighter colored lines. Generally travel associated cases. 
> 
> We do expect to start to increase as dengue starts increasing in the Northern hemisphere. 
> 
> Most of this giant increase you saw was happening in the Southern hemisphere, as they were in the summer now going into the winter, but now we're going into our summer peak transmission season. 
> 
> So in 2024, we've had triple the number of travel associate cases, generally at a time when incidence of travel associated cases are low. 
> 
> But that number has slowly gone down over time, just because of the Southern hemisphere is now going into winter, but we do expect this number to start to increase markedly as the Northern hemisphere starts to get more affected by dengue.
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:10:18]
> 
> What I want to do now is talk about the response to dengue cases in non-endemic areas. 
> 
> Now, this is a guidance document that we are in the process of creating. It is almost done. But there's a few tweaks that need to happen. 
> 
> But in the meantime, I want to show you basically what this is going to be all about. 
> 
> So this document will have, talk about three different areas. 
> 
> How do you in investigate suspected dengue cases? 
> 
> What happens if you have travel associated dengue cases in your area?
> 
> And what happens if local transmission occurs in your area?
> 
> ...
> 
> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:13:30]
> 
> So the next would be how do you respond in travel associated cases? 
> 
> So there's three things that we consider. 
> 
> One is our Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus present in the area, particularly Aedes aegypti, since that's a much more efficient transmitter than Aedes albopictus.
> 
> The second, are you in an area that's likely to experience or possibly going experience a local transmission? 
> 
> And so what we've decide kind of arbitrarily defined this is have travel associated dengue cases been regularly reported in your area, or has local dengue transmission occurred in the past in the area?
> 
> And this would be primarily places, mainly places in south Florida or southern Texas, but also elsewhere to a lesser  probability. 
> 
> And the other thing is what is the probability of dengue transmission in your area?

> So areas with a moderate probability of dengue transmission, one is to inform healthcare providers to consider testing for dengue in patients with compatible symptoms, after excluding more common causes of febrile illness.
> 
> This is probably the most difficult part of this guidance because of, obviously, that dengue, many of the symptoms of dengue kind of overlap with a lot of other things that are not dengue. 
> 
> And so trying to figure out exactly when to test for dengue and when to not test for dengue is a little bit difficult. 
> 
> So we're-- that's one of the areas that we're still working on, on the guidance, when exactly would we recommend testing for dengue?

> I mean, in a person who basically maybe hasn't traveled, so that's one issue that's complicated.

> 
> If you do have local transmission, you might want to think about increasing surveillance, offering dengue testing and gathering information on recent febrile illness for other household members in particular, and strongly consider enhanced surveillance around the home, particularly if the source of dengue introduction is unknown. 
> 
> So you can also go door to door trying to identify additional cases, which can help. 
> 
> And also testing Aedes aegypti mosquitoes for dengue infection using RTPCR. 
> 
> We get a lot of questions about whether you should do mosquito surveillance around for dengue around local transmission cases.
> 
> It's an adjunct to looking for human cases and it's also pretty labor intensive. And the more traps you put out, the more likely you are to find it, but it's not a particularly sensitive way of finding dengue transmission in area. 
> 
> But if you do find it, it clearly confirms that there is local transmission risk ongoing.
> 
> Healthcare provider outreach is important. 
> 
> If you do find local transmission in your area, certainly you want to warn healthcare workers because we want people to get properly diagnosed and treated, and to be for healthcare workers to look out for it, because they don't-- dengue is clearly not going to be first on their mind when they see a patient in the ED or elsewhere. 
> 
> And also consider testing for dengue and people with compatible symptoms. 
> 
> Also reporting is key. We want to know where these cases are important for both the state and local health department, as well as us and to monitor the situation nationally.
> 
> And continuing mosquito control educational campaigns as well.

> Lyle Petersen, CDC [00:25:36]
> 
> So how can you help?
> 
> Continuing to raise awareness about the increasing risk of dengue, particularly among travelers, thinking about local transmission and certainly we're coming into the peak transmission season for dengue. 
> 
> So being alert is critical, and also making sure that clinicians are trying to get clinicians to order FDA approved diagnostic testing for dengue.
