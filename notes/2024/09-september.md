> Question [07:00:08]
> 
> So this is gonna be a long hypothetical. I apologize in advance.
> 
> Suppose hypothetically, the drug was approved with labeling that dictated it should be only used in women with uncomplicated UTIs who had demonstrated or a set of criteria for meeting a category of very high risk, for example, a positive ESBL culture within a month or something like that. And the sponsor was required to do a postmarketing study to demonstrate that the prescribing behavior at some acceptable performance criteria met that restriction. 
> 
> If following through on the rest of the hypothetical, the postmarketing study then demonstrated that the stewardship effort had been a failure, at that point, what options does the agency have available to it? 
> 
> The context for my question is that I have been told informally in this room and by different parts of the agency, that, in fact, there's not really a mechanism for withdrawing approval based on post marketing, unless it's a safety concern at the individual patient level.
> 
> ...
> 
> John Farley, FDA [07:01:50]
> 
> There will probably be a multi component response with various media forms involved. 
> 
> I'm thinking through the question. I think it's a good one. 
> 
> I think what would happen, so because, I think the agency was gonna focus on the tools that we have sort of in the label itself, but I don't know that that's going to address your question. 
> 
> Your sort of your hypothetical is sort of in a postmarket setting, there's a lot of inappropriate use going on, basically. 
> 
> Question
> 
> My impression as-- my personal impression is that the committee is struggling with the ability of protections that are built into the label to protect the community at large against practice that results in the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, carbapenem resistance. 
> 
> And so I'm trying to find out, if in fact this plays out that way and we see yet again that labeling is ineffective, do we have a way of correcting that error or is it-- is there a lack of an option? 
> 
> John Farley, FDA [07:03:12]
> 
> I don't think there's a lack of an option. 
> 
> The scenario is kind of twofold. So the first situation is data that's demonstrating that there's a fair amount of use that most physicians would regard as inappropriate use. And that scenario one, I think in that case, we would, first of all, work with the sponsor.
> 
> The labeling is a joint process. We have to agree. But they are as committed as we are to ensuring that use is appropriate and there may be additional changes in the wording of indication, etc.
> 
> FDA as well as professional organizations have the ability to communicate with physicians around that. So that would be something that we could do because I think we're in a setting where I think the general sense of the committee is there is an unmet need for a product like this. So there are some patients that are potentially benefiting. 
> 
> Of course, if we get full resistance throughout the population, that's going to be a different story. 
> 
> I think the second scenario is if there is microbiologic population data that that seems to indicate that the drug is driving resistance in some way. 
> 
> And FDA does regard resistance as a safety concern. And so we would have more tools at our disposal at that point, rather than just labeling and communication. 
> 
> ...
> 
> John Farley, FDA [07:21:53]
> 
> I think what I would point out is that labeling is not insignificant. 
> 
> And, so the next month or two, the agency and the sponsor are going to work very hard on that to address what we've heard from you today. 
> 
> It's not insignificant. I mean, the prescribing information that the FDA writes ends up in all sorts of electronic tools that physicians use at the bedside every day, that's where that data comes from. It comes from the label. 
> 
> Secondly, I think with electronic health records systems, they are programmed to pop up things that are relevant to the label. For example, if there's a limitation of use that says this shouldn't be used as step down for complicated urinary tract infections, and somebody is writing that, that's generally going to pop up in the EHR system to educate physicians on the spot as they're writing the prescription. 
> 
> So hopefully that helps.
> 
> I'm optimistic that that labeling does make a difference. And that's why we're having this discussion today.

> Lindsey Baden, AMDAC (Chairperson) [07:34:50]
> 
> Overall, I have the sense from the committee, that for certain circumstances where this agent may be beneficial to our patients, there's a high risk of off-label use, significant community risk to amplification of resistance, particularly CRE, there's individual risk to that amplification, not just community risk, mitigation is likely the center on, in a timely identification of who's at highest risk, whatever tools sort of make sense for that, that are available. 
> 
> Post-marketing surveillance will be essential as this is a dynamic problem. So the solutions will have to keep up with the evolutionary pressures. 
> 
> And if there is some mechanism for regulatory review with some period of time and some new data with postmarketing studies to be able to further refine the label and the education and the optimization of its use, I think that is sort of what I heard, is multiple themes from the committee. 
> 
> And, if that doesn't provoke questions from the agency, I think from the committee's discussion, my sense is we share your enthusiasm for new treatments for our patients, we are concerned with how this will fit in so that it doesn't create new problems for us, and we appreciate the agency's hard work and really trying to think this through and get as much input as possible, including from us.
