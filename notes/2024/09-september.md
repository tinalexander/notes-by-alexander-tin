> Robert Ford, Abbott Laboratories
> 
> These are medically necessary products that save lives, and Jim, we have a history of developing products for premature babies across all of our portfolio for decades, not just in nutrition, but in medical devices. We develop cardiovascular devices for congenital heart failure, in our medicine business, we do it. 
> 
> So the decision to pull a product is not an easy one, but if the system that's in place today is not going to value the science and the data, if the system is not going to value what health care professionals that spend their lives treating these babies, if those aren't going to be respected and taken into account, then yeah, we have to think about at least what is the implication of removing a product. 
> 
> Now, I'm hopeful I don't have to do that. I'm hopeful those that can make decisions to ensure that there's a reliable and consistent supply of this product, that they take action, but it's something we've had to contemplate.

> Jim Jones, FDA [00:44:41]
> 
> We say this routinely, that the food safety system in the United States is based on both the government and the industry following the rules. 
> 
> And so, if the industry, if a manufacturer is going to choose not to follow the rules, they're going to likely have some opportunity to get away with it until they're caught. 
> 
> It's sort of like in any laws we have in the United States, if there's someone who's just choosing, I'm not going to follow the rule, whether it's about speeding or jaywalking or any rule, there will be a period of time where they're going to get away with it. 
> 
> Obviously that's not what we're looking for, but we need everybody in the system to be playing their role and for the manufacturing community, it's about following the rules that have been created. And for us, it's about setting clear and enforceable rules and then also doing enforcement.
> 
> ...
> 
> Jim Jones, FDA [00:47:10]
> 
> It would be a pretty egregious violation for us to go straight to some form of civil penalty, which is what you're referring to, where there's a dollar amount associated with it.
> 
> And then, the scope of the violation would inform the size of the penalty. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Jim Jones, FDA [01:05:56]
> 
> We do not even remotely the same presence in communities as local law enforcement do.
> 
> These products, these ingredients used in food, make the food adulterated. 
> 
> We have the opportunity periodically to take them off the market. But again, we're not going to have nearly the presence in communities that local law enforcement would have.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [01:08:32]
> 
> Why do thousands of illegal products remain on the market? Even though FDA has only authorized a sale of roughly three dozen e-cigarette products.
> 
> Brian King, FDA [01:08:41]
> 
> So very succinctly there's three major factors. One is the sheer size of this marketplace, which is unprecedented. 
> 
> We alone have received applications for 27 million products. 
> 
> We also need time to conduct investigations, which requires resources, which why we need more. 
> 
> The latter is also the legal implications and in order for us to seize products that would require thousands and thousands of individual seizures that would then result in thousands and thousands of cases in federal district courts across the country, which would be untenable. 
> 
> And so the realities are that we continue to make progress. We're making a dent, we've done a lot of first of their kind actions, but we need more resources and we need other agencies to step to the table as well.
> 
> ...
> 
> Rep Kim Schrier [01:51:53]
> 
> I was wondering if you could just talk about the impact to clinical care for these very low birth weight, extremely premature babies, if these, one of these two cow milk based preterm infant nutritional products were to leave the U.S. market. And then also if you could touch on it, are there FDA barriers to getting donor breast milk to these high risk infants?
> 
> Jim Jones, FDA [01:52:20]
> 
> Thanks for that question. We are very concerned about the potential for, we do not know that it will happen, but the potential for one or both of the manufacturers to leave that market, for business reasons. So that's very concerning to us. 
> 
> Secretary Becerra has asked our colleagues at the NIH to pull together a group of experts, neonatologists and others, to give him a report about the risks and the benefits associated with these products. 
> 
> That report is due to the secretary, next week.
> 
> ...
> 
> Brian King, FDA [02:01:43]
> 
> I just want to start and reinforce that FDA has not abandoned the menthol product standard. 
> 
> Indeed, we remain, it's a priority for us. We followed through rule making processes and it's presently with the White House and it continues to be a priority for us.
> 
> ...
> 
> Jim Jones, FDA [02:29:12]
> 
> We have been pretty clear, I think, in the last year or so that, that we think that there is, there are a number of studies that shown an association between ultra processed foods and some adverse health outcomes, but an association, we do not think there, the data right now is robust enough to demonstrate causality. 
> 
> And that, therefore what we need is more research to more definitively answer that question one way or another. We're not saying it does, there is causality. We need better research to inform the question of causality between ultra processed foods and a range of chronic disease associated with diet.
> 
> So at this workshop, what we are going to be doing is to begin to build out what would the research agenda look like to answer the question related to causality? 
> 
> So ultimately we will need this research if we're going to be able to answer the question of what do ultraprocessed foods do as it relates to a range of diet related chronic diseases.
> 
> ...
> 
> Brian King, FDA [02:37:28]
> 
> I think one important thing to consider is whether the products are accurately declared or not. 
> 
> And what we know, particularly through our recent seizure action we did at the border at LAX airport, of 18 million dollars of illicit products, is 99% of them were misdeclared, which means that we've got to open boxes.
> 
> And it's not just import alerts, for accurately declared content. That said, if you want to open boxes, you need resources and you need people. And that's also why we need Customs and Border Protection as a key partner here. 
> 
> So we've-- we've had some actions already. I'm hopeful there'll be more with a new task force. But we are unresourced given the magnitude of the situation and we also have to make sure that all the key players in this space are committed to making it a priority as well.
> 
> ...
> 
> Jim Jones, FDA [02:56:47]
> 
> We are working very diligently on our proposed rule that would require front of pack labeling as you've described.
> 
> It is within a relatively short period of time before it'll be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for their review. 
> 
> So we are very confident that by the end of this calendar year, we will have a proposed rule.
> 
> Rep Jan Schakowsky [02:57:07]
> 
> So when do you think-- what's the deadline now?
> 
> Jim Jones, FDA [02:57:10]
> 
> We are hoping to have this package submitted to OMB with the next couple of weeks and they have a 90 day review period, which would have us, so with a proposed--
> 
> Rep Jan Schakowsky [02:57:17]
> 
> What was the problem?
> 
> Jim Jones, FDA [02:57:20]
> 
> I wouldn't say that there's been a problem. 
> 
> The amount of analysis necessary to support this rule making is quite extensive. 
> 
> And so it's really been grinding through all of the work to pull this package together for the proposed rule.
> 
> ...
> 
> Jim Jones, FDA [03:00:13]
> 
> Within the next couple of months, we should have a proposed announcement related to red dye number three.
> 
> But as it relates to other chemicals that are authorized for use in food, or there as contaminants again, I go back to, we are going to be having a public meeting in a couple of weeks. 
> 
> That's again going to describe how we propose to select chemicals for review. 
> 
> We want to make sure we're working on those that have the potentially the greatest risk and the process that we will use to evaluate those chemicals. 
> 
> So again, we are very interested in having a much more ambitious post-market chemical review program at the FDA.

> Question [07:00:08]
> 
> So this is gonna be a long hypothetical. I apologize in advance.
> 
> Suppose hypothetically, the drug was approved with labeling that dictated it should be only used in women with uncomplicated UTIs who had demonstrated or a set of criteria for meeting a category of very high risk, for example, a positive ESBL culture within a month or something like that. And the sponsor was required to do a postmarketing study to demonstrate that the prescribing behavior at some acceptable performance criteria met that restriction. 
> 
> If following through on the rest of the hypothetical, the postmarketing study then demonstrated that the stewardship effort had been a failure, at that point, what options does the agency have available to it? 
> 
> The context for my question is that I have been told informally in this room and by different parts of the agency, that, in fact, there's not really a mechanism for withdrawing approval based on post marketing, unless it's a safety concern at the individual patient level.
> 
> ...
> 
> John Farley, FDA [07:01:50]
> 
> There will probably be a multi component response with various media forms involved. 
> 
> I'm thinking through the question. I think it's a good one. 
> 
> I think what would happen, so because, I think the agency was gonna focus on the tools that we have sort of in the label itself, but I don't know that that's going to address your question. 
> 
> Your sort of your hypothetical is sort of in a postmarket setting, there's a lot of inappropriate use going on, basically. 
> 
> Question
> 
> My impression as-- my personal impression is that the committee is struggling with the ability of protections that are built into the label to protect the community at large against practice that results in the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, carbapenem resistance. 
> 
> And so I'm trying to find out, if in fact this plays out that way and we see yet again that labeling is ineffective, do we have a way of correcting that error or is it-- is there a lack of an option? 
> 
> John Farley, FDA [07:03:12]
> 
> I don't think there's a lack of an option. 
> 
> The scenario is kind of twofold. So the first situation is data that's demonstrating that there's a fair amount of use that most physicians would regard as inappropriate use. And that scenario one, I think in that case, we would, first of all, work with the sponsor.
> 
> The labeling is a joint process. We have to agree. But they are as committed as we are to ensuring that use is appropriate and there may be additional changes in the wording of indication, etc.
> 
> FDA as well as professional organizations have the ability to communicate with physicians around that. So that would be something that we could do because I think we're in a setting where I think the general sense of the committee is there is an unmet need for a product like this. So there are some patients that are potentially benefiting. 
> 
> Of course, if we get full resistance throughout the population, that's going to be a different story. 
> 
> I think the second scenario is if there is microbiologic population data that that seems to indicate that the drug is driving resistance in some way. 
> 
> And FDA does regard resistance as a safety concern. And so we would have more tools at our disposal at that point, rather than just labeling and communication. 
> 
> ...
> 
> John Farley, FDA [07:21:53]
> 
> I think what I would point out is that labeling is not insignificant. 
> 
> And, so the next month or two, the agency and the sponsor are going to work very hard on that to address what we've heard from you today. 
> 
> It's not insignificant. I mean, the prescribing information that the FDA writes ends up in all sorts of electronic tools that physicians use at the bedside every day, that's where that data comes from. It comes from the label. 
> 
> Secondly, I think with electronic health records systems, they are programmed to pop up things that are relevant to the label. For example, if there's a limitation of use that says this shouldn't be used as step down for complicated urinary tract infections, and somebody is writing that, that's generally going to pop up in the EHR system to educate physicians on the spot as they're writing the prescription. 
> 
> So hopefully that helps.
> 
> I'm optimistic that that labeling does make a difference. And that's why we're having this discussion today. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Lindsey Baden, AMDAC (Chairperson) [07:34:50]
> 
> Overall, I have the sense from the committee, that for certain circumstances where this agent may be beneficial to our patients, there's a high risk of off-label use, significant community risk to amplification of resistance, particularly CRE, there's individual risk to that amplification, not just community risk, mitigation is likely the center on, in a timely identification of who's at highest risk, whatever tools sort of make sense for that, that are available. 
> 
> Post-marketing surveillance will be essential as this is a dynamic problem. So the solutions will have to keep up with the evolutionary pressures. 
> 
> And if there is some mechanism for regulatory review with some period of time and some new data with postmarketing studies to be able to further refine the label and the education and the optimization of its use, I think that is sort of what I heard, is multiple themes from the committee. 
> 
> And, if that doesn't provoke questions from the agency, I think from the committee's discussion, my sense is we share your enthusiasm for new treatments for our patients, we are concerned with how this will fit in so that it doesn't create new problems for us, and we appreciate the agency's hard work and really trying to think this through and get as much input as possible, including from us.
