> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:07:46]
> 
> We saw this clinical syndrome kind of presenting in dairy cattle where dairy cattle would go off being, we would see decreases in their milk production, low grade fevers. That kind of is where this started as we started some of those conversations with the states. 
> 
> From there, we found the detection of the HPAI in some of the milk samples collected from those animals. 
> 
> It is still at this point, I would say unclear whether the underlying etiology really is HPAI in cattle causing this illness, or if the illness is predisposed in animals being able to pick up HPAI in their milk secretions. That's the piece that we're still really trying to understand. And that's the epi work that we're really leveraging with our field staff, and our state partners at this point. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:08:36]
> 
> From what we are seeing in that initial epi work, we're seeing some sort of lateral transmission possibly occurring within these herds.
> 
> At this point though, we're kind of thinking that may be more related to a mechanical transmission component that's happening, since this is really kind of isolated to those dairy animals at this stage. And predominantly it's isolated even further to those lactating dairy cattle. 
> 
> So we're really trying to go back onto some of these farms, look at the process in the milking parlor, really kind of hone in, is there a mechanical transmission happening that this is more related to like a mastitis type event of high path transmitted mechanically between cattle and a process? 
> 
> Our team's also been working heavily to create epi questionnaire that we're taking out to the field staff, taking out to these farms and better understand, how we see the HPAI moving within.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:11:23]
> 
> One thing of note, the cattle that do, uh, show this clinical syndrome do recover in one to two weeks is what we're being told and what we're actually seeing in the field. 
> 
> So even though there is that lateral transmission occurring within the herd, the herd usually clears the infection within one to three weeks. But again, not something that we really have a full understanding on. And are continuing to do some studies to better understand that.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USD [00:15:31]
> 
> The samples that we're used to testing are swabs. And, when we tested milk, the milk was a little bit more challenging for us to test. These cows, clinically, had very thick milk. 
> 
> They would go off feed and produce a very thick milk and it was very obvious they would segregate them into the sick pen. And, we would test that milk and have challenges with inhibition. 
> 
> So laboratories ended up having to dilute the milk and we've added some various enzymes. And one of the things that we've been using is molecular transport media that contains like guanidine thiocyanate to break up some of the material within milk, to be able for us to get accurate PCRs.
> 
> The CT values in the PCRs in milk have been remarkable. We've seen PCRs as with, as low of a CT value as 10, and typically are in the teens. So we occasionally may see a clinical cow with CT values in the 20, but most of the time they're in the teens.
> 
> When we've obtained, nasal swabs or respiratory samples from these cattle, we're not seeing those CT values. Most of the time, those swabs are negative. Occasionally we get CT values in the thirties, but we have not been able to successfully sequence or recover a virus yet from a nasal swab, although we suspect it's very early stages. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:17:37]
> 
> So when Dr. Lyon said that this is behaving differently, that is-- that is most likely the reason with those CT values in the milk. It, just makes sense that that is the fluid that is-- that that would allow for the most risk of transmission to cow to cow. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:24:39]
> 
> We don't know at this point, the mechanical transmission in fomites piece. It may be the same process. 
> 
> We're terming it mechanical transmission at this point, because if there is-- if it is spreading in the process of the milking parlor, it may be that on those fomites, whether it's the clothing, whether it's the gloves, towels, whether it's in the dipping cups, whether it's in the suction cups, that's the piece that we don't know. But we think there may be an active transmission occurring at that stage.
> 
> Again, as we continue to get more epi information, as we continue to get different details from the farms, we do hope that we'll be able to kind of hone in on, is it truly fomite or is it more specific to an actual active transmission process in the parlor.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:25:56]
> 
> I don't know that I would say cow to cow specifically, because we haven't seen any true indication that the cows are actively shedding virus and exposing it directly to other cows. 
> 
> As Dr. Robbe-Austerman said, we're not seeing a lot of CT counts in those nasal swabs that kind of indicate viruses actively there. And it's moving between the cattle that way, which again, so that's where we're really looking at as that lateral transmission piece of something is moving it within the herd. 
> 
> It may not be cow to cow specifically.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:28:17]
> 
> So the herd in Michigan had animals that came from the Texas. One of the Texas herds in Michigan cattle did end up having infection later on. 
> 
> Again, we don't necessarily know that the cow gave it to the other cow, or if there was that human intervention piece where there was a lateral transmission occurring through that milking process. 
> 
> So the cow may not have given it to the cow.
> 
> But there was a, there was a transmission that did take place in that lateral mechanical space.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:30:37]
> 
> Generally were seeing only about 10% of the milking herd really affected in a lot of these reported cases. And it's a very-- like there's not been any mortality shown in this. So we're looking at 10% of the herd affected and no real mortality associated.
> 
> Most cattle do respond within that one to two weeks span.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:33:03]
> 
> So this virus is 3.13 in the GenoFlu pipeline. 
> 
> It's not a common virus, but it's very much a descendant of the viruses that have been dominating the flyways in the Pacific and the central flyways at the United States.
> 
> The cow viruses so far have all been similar enough that it would be consistent with the single spillover event or a couple of very closely related spillover event events. 
> 
> We are not seeing any different viruses in the dairy cows that can't relate back. So, so far, we don't have any evidence that this is being introduced multiple times into the cows.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:34:46]
> 
> We're able to confirm the epidemiology when we know cows move from one affected farm to the next, we're able to see that evidence within the sequences. 
> 
> So again, it's very consistent to a single spillover event and then spread based on cattle movement. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:35:30]
> 
> We haven't formally developed some active surveillance plans around the peri-domestic wildlife in the barns and stuff, but that's planning. 
> 
> We have tested skunks on or near the premises. We have tested, you know, wild birds. And of course the cats on these dairies have been affected and. And the cats have a high level of mortality on these dairy farms, if they're-- and most of them we assume are being allowed access to some of this milk.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:37:10]
> 
> In fecal material, we have tested and the vast majority of those have been negative. Some have had very high CTs, but based on our experience, we would not be able to rule out contamination because they're being tested on the same plate as very hot milk.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:37:56]
> 
> We have really been encouraging our laboratories to be open to testing animals with clinical signs. 
> 
> We did have a laboratory go back in their archive and test samples from abortions, which as you know, many times abortions remain undiagnosed. 
> 
> And so they tested all the abortions submitted to their laboratory from January through March. And all of those were not detected. 
> 
> We have not had any reports of sick beef cattle, but we're confident that with our NAHLN laboratories, they would, if they did get a non-negative, they would send that to us. 
> 
> We have authorized testing for sick pigs and we, those so far, have all been non-negative, although there's-- sorry, all negative, although we have very limited samples yet collected from swine in the areas. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:41:23]
> 
> All I can say is so far with virus isolation, when we've tested whole blood, we are not detecting. 
> 
> So right now there's no evidence that we have that suggests that this virus is systemic at this point in time. So we're testing cows that have very low CT values in the milk, but their whole blood is negative. And that suggests that this virus has tropism for udder tissue and maybe the epithelial udder tissue. 
> 
> We don't know that yet, but right now we don't have evidence that the virus is actively replicating within the body of the cow, other than the udder.
> 
> ...
> 
> Christine Szablewski, CDC [00:44:07]
> 
> There have been some discussions about doing some studies to look at asymptomatic persons, to see if there's any kind of serologic evidence or even nasal canal infection in those farm workers. 
> 
> But right now, those are just discussions. 
> 
> What I can say is that when we first saw the outbreaks of high path AI in poultry herds, we did publish us do a seroprevalence study, and we did publish that and I will drop that into the chat.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:45:39]
> 
> I don't think that we have full clarity. 
> 
> We do have one dairy that had a confirmed poultry that have the same genotype. We have sequenced the poultry. 
> 
> There were no cows that were sequenced because we didn't know at the time. And so-- but that sequence is very consistent and like, it basically is that-- I don't want to call it an ancestral sequence because this virus collects snips fairly quickly, but it is very consistent. 
> 
> And all of the detection so far in cattle are clustered around that. 
> 
> What we know we need to do is try to figure out what virus within the clade and this genotype have the ability to infect mammary tissue in cows. And I think that's one of the hot topics that is being discussed among our scientists.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:47:48]
> 
> And again, we're seeing-- we're only seeing this occurring in those lactating dairy animals at this stage, which again, pushes it back into thinking that there's more of that lateral transmission occurring related to that milking process. 
> 
> And as Dr. Robbe-Austerman said earlier, well not seeing the virus really circulating systemically through the animals at this point, based on the samples that we do have, which again, kind of points back to there's that affinity to that mammary tissue pointing to that milking process, playing a larger role in the transmission than maybe some other pathways.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:58:57]
> 
> I do want to point out that our reported goat event that occurred in the state of Minnesota is a different genotype. And we did test milk in those goats and the milk was negative. So that genotype performed typically like we would expect, which is neurologic disease. 
> 
> So this virus is different. And so-- but we need to understand if this virus actually has a broader species tropism than just cattle. So there's a lot of questions that we're currently trying to answer. And it's a really broad effort.

- **Date:** received April 1, 2024

> The patient worked directly with sick cows at a dairy, so the virus was most likely transmitted through that close contact. We are working with other agencies to provide guidance to dairies about precautions they and their workers can take to minimize the risk of transmission from animals, and we are asking dairies to encourage workers who are sick to get tested.
