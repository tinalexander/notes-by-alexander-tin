- **Attribution:** Public Health Seattle & King County spokesperson Sharon Bogan
- **Date:** received April 19, 2024

> We are currently aware of five cases in King County that appear to be linked to this ongoing national investigation. However, FDA is currently investigating and has not confirmed if the cases are a result of a potential counterfeit or mishandled product or a result of Botox side effects.  The five people reported receiving Botox (botulinum toxin injections) at a cosmetic spa. None of the individuals were hospitalized.
> 
> FDA is the best source of information on these cases and others around the country that may be associated. 
> 
> Consumers should report suspected counterfeit Botox products to FDA at 800-551-3989, or through www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/email/oc/oci/contact.cfm.
> 
> Health care professionals and consumers should report adverse events related to the use of any medications, including suspected counterfeit medications to FDA's MedWatch Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program
> 
> If systemic botulism is suspected, health care professionals should call the patient’s local health department immediately.
> 
> The CDC also released this information which may be helpful. https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/outbreaks/harmful-reactions-botox-injections.html

## Embargoed USDA press conference on school nutrition standards

- Source: conference call
- Attribution: hosted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
- Date: occurred April 23, 2024

> Tom Vilsack, USDA [00:12:09]
> 
> I think it's important to underscore that school meals matter. They matter for the students who consume them, in some cases, in many cases, in far too many cases, it is often the only meal or meals that youngsters may get during the day. It matters to them and to their families. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Tom Vilsack, USDA [00:12:49]
> 
> We have quality partners that we work with in connection with school nutrition, and that's the school nutrition experts, the folks on the line, the school nutritionist folks who every single day care deeply about the kids they serve. And we have tried to be a good partner with them, with unprecedented support over the last several years, as they've faced a multitude of challenges with supply chain.
> We also recognize the important role that industry plays, specifically when they can participate to reformulate foods, to meet the new standards. A good example is the dairy industry's work on reduced sugar and flavored milk. 
> 
> And I think all of this is designed to ensure that students have quality meals and that we meet parent's expectation that their children are receive healthy and nutritious meals at school. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Tom Vilsack, USDA [00:14:11]
> 
> This is a rule that's based on science and very consistent with, and needs to be consistent with the dietary guidelines. 
> The rule that was formulated with a significant amount of feedback. Over 136,000 comments were received during the comment period. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:25:19]
> 
> I'm wondering if you can expand a little bit on why you decided against limiting flavored milk for K-5, K-8 schools. And then also, can you address what will happen to schools who fall short of meeting these guidelines this fall or in the coming years? Thanks so much.
> 
> Tom Vilsack, USDA [00:25:37]
> 
> Well, the challenge, I think, is to make sure that children have access and actually consume milk. And I think most school nutrition officials would tell you that youngsters certainly gravitate towards the flavored milk option. 
> 
> I think the key here was that we worked with the industry, knowing that we were going to be focused on added sugars, and challenged the industry and the industry stepped up to the challenge and basically is working on making sure that the flavored milk will in fact have limits on added sugar by the fall of 2025. 
> And I think it's just basically we want to make sure kids have access to to milk. It's an option and choice, and it's one that many, many children choose. That way they get the vitamins and the minerals that they need.
> 
> Given the structure of this rule, that will over time provide for weekly consumption limits on added sugars, we thought that it could fit within the decision making that would be made at the local level. Obviously it's a decision that each school district can make whether to offer the flavored milk or not. 
> 
> But I think one of the reasons they might is because they will probably find that it's consumed more frequently by the children.
> 
> To your second question, Cindy if I could ask you, I think we would continue to work with with school districts, and the expectation and anticipation is given the transition period that we have built into the rule, that we're going to see compliance. 
> 
> As has been indicated, the industry is already working on providing many of the products that will meet the standards, and will continue to be a good solid partner. 
> 
> But Cindy, if you want to add anything to the question about what happens if the standards aren't met?
> 
> Cindy Long, USDA [00:27:38]
> 
> Yeah, no, I think as Secretary Vilsack noted, that the gradual nature of the rule, along with the extensive input and work we're doing with industry, is really designed to make schools be successful with the new standards, which is our goal. 
> 
> But with respect to what happens if a school, you know, despite its best intentions, isn't quite there at a particular point in time. I want to emphasize that one of the things we were able to do during the pandemic was to provide flexibility so that schools wouldn't face financial penalties if they weren't able to meet every aspects of the standard. 
> 
> Well, I want to share with you that we have made that flexibility permanent, in our regulations about school meal oversight. So going forward, if a school is working towards the standards and trying, but is falling short in some way, states are no longer required to automatically take a financial penalty to the school. 
> 
> The state has the ability to work with the school, to help us bring us into help work with them, and let them have a little more time if they needed. And so financial penalties would be only reserved for folks that were willfully or much more seriously violating the program.
> 
> ...
> 
> JoNel Aleccia, AP [00:29:26]
> 
> The press release says USDA will require only one sodium reduction, not the three incremental reductions that were proposed last year. And I think last year, the proposal would've reduced sodium by 30% by the fall of 2029. So how are-- how is this new single reduction-- what level does it reduce it to?
> 
> Tom Vilsack, USDA [00:29:52]
> 
> I'm going to get this. I hope I get this right, but if I don't, Cindy Long can correct me.
> 
> By the fall of 27, a 10% reduction on sodium on breakfast and a 15% reduction for lunch.
> 
> Congress basically provided a rider to the budget process, which basically instructed us to essentially provide this. So it's a very,-- it's very consistent with the congressional directive. In other words, Congress directed us to do this.
> 
> ...
> 
> Cindy Long, USDA [00:34:02]
> 
> When the rule publishes tomorrow, there will be a detailed impact analysis as there always is with a major rule. And it'll show that  the cost associated with this rule are very, very modest, compared to the overall size of the program. I believe it's on the order of maybe something like 1% over the five to 10 year projection period.

> Pursuant to section 381.0031(6), Florida Statutes, and Rules 64D-3.036 and 3.041, of the Florida Administrative Code, information contained within a required case report or collected as part of an epidemiological investigation is confidential and exempt from provisions of section 119.071(1), Florida Statutes. While the case information is confidential and exempt, I would like to provide you with further information around your request.
> 
> The Department’s Division of Medical Quality Assurance (MQA) licenses and regulates over 100 license types and over 1.4 million licensed health care providers. Florida law requires that health care workers practicing in the state must be appropriately licensed. The unlicensed practice of a regulated health care profession is a felony in Florida. The Unlicensed Activity Unit (ULA) of MQA here in Florida is unique when compared to other states across the nation, as it is the only dedicated unit focused on investigating alleged instances of unlicensed health care activity. All unlicensed activity allegations, regardless of profession, are taken seriously and reviewed for legal sufficiency. Patients are encouraged to check the license status of their health care providers by visiting www.FLHealthSource.gov and clicking on “Verify A License.”
> 
> We would appreciate it if you would communicate this information to the community to ensure unlicensed activity in Florida is reported. If unlicensed activity is suspected, make a report by calling 1-877-HALT-ULA or emailing HALTULA@flhealth.gov.

> Thank you again for reaching out to the Department and please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.

## Press conference by HHS on finalizing rule to support reproductive healthcare privacy

- **Source:** [livestream](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/04/22/biden-harris-administration-issues-new-rule-support-reproductive-health-care-privacy-under-hipaa.html)
- **Attribution:** hosted by the Department of Health and Human Services
- **Date:** occurred April 22, 2024

> Melanie Fontes Rainer, HHS [00:19:33]
> 
> So the rule is actually meant to help when women travel.
> 
> We know, as a result of Dobbs, that people have to travel to receive lawful reproductive healthcare. And so when a woman travels from one state where the care might be banned to another state to receive lawful reproductive healthcare, no matter what that healthcare is, whether it's a pill or it's a procedure, it's just a medical examination, that when that woman goes home, her medical records will be protected, herself, her home providers who literally had nothing to do with the care she received in the first instance, they'll be protected. And they'll be able to say, no, you cannot have this information. 
> 
> And the provider in the state where she traveled will also be protected from folks reaching in to go after that type of medical care, which is one of the main goals of this rule, so that women can seek care even in the face of the patchwork of laws we have now across the country, how people receive care.
> 
> Xavier Becerra, HHS [00:20:29]
> 
> Can I just add real quickly on that? 
> 
> We have no illusion that everything that the president has urged us to do with our authorities is going to undo Dobbs. 
> 
> Dobbs took away rights. Until we have a national law that re institutes Roe versus Wade, we're going to have issues, but that doesn't stop us from doing everything we can to protect every American's right to access the care they need and to have the privacy they need.
> 
> Understanding again, Dobbs had consequences.
> 
> ...
> 
> Emma Beavins, Fierce Healthcare [00:23:34]
> 
> Can you speak to any changes that are in the final rule as compared to the proposed rule from stakeholder feedback you got on the proposed rule?
> 
> Melanie Fontes Rainer, HHS [00:23:42]
> 
> Sure. So one of the areas we got a lot of comments on was the exact example I used earlier. So, someone travels from state A to state B to receive lawful care, and then they go home to state A.
> 
> And what what's happening is on the ground in state A, law enforcement may be going to state A and saying, we want this information, we want this data. And that state A, those providers, they didn't provide the healthcare. It's their patient. And they assume it was probably lawful, but they didn't provide the healthcare. 
> 
> And so the final rule has a presumption of legality in those instances, just those instances to help take some of the burden off providers and to make it more workable for those providers would be one change. 
> 
> I think generally speaking the rule is mostly finalized as it was in the proposed rule. Not a lot of huge changes.
> 
> ...
> 
> Chelsea Cirruzzo, Politico [00:24:37]
> 
> I know some Democrats had asked that the final rule required that law enforcement have a warrant to request this information, but the proposed rule required a subpoena or a lower threshold. Has that changed in the final rule?
> 
> Melanie Fontes Rainer, HHS [00:24:50]
> 
> So we did receive incoming from some senators specific to that point. 
> 
> The final rule doesn't get to requirement for a subpoena or a warrant. Those things are under the existing HIPAA privacy rule and they continue to operate in the same way. 
> 
> However, this is a really important step. We know that we can do more in the space and we're happy to work with our partners in Congress to think about how else to protect privacy, right? 
> 
> This is a really critical action that will help people feel safer when they go seek care. It'll also help providers. 
> 
> I've spoken to many providers who, I mean, you've probably heard the same thing who say I live in, 'we'll just pick on California, but I live in California. But when I go home to state X, I'm really worried about what's gonna happen to me.' Right? 
> 
> And so we know that there's a lot of those instances and that we have to do more in this space to think about healthcare.

## National Milk Producers Federation official on HPAI in dairy

- **Source:** webinar
- **Attribution:** hosted by the Swine Health Information Center
- **Date:** occurred April 19, 2024

> Jamie Jonker, NMPF [00:52:15]
> 
> These are what are typical things that are being seen in the affected dairy cattle. They are multiparous. So what that means in dairy language, they are second lactation orolder. They are often 150 days in milk or longer.
> 
> And when a herd gets infected, we see about 10% of the dairy cattle having clinical symptoms. So 10% of the lactating cattle. 
> 
> But there's minimal mortality. And the mortality that seems to be occurring in dairy animals that have the clinical symptoms are the effects of secondary infections, secondary opportunistic organisms, that are infecting these animals that have high path AI. 
> 
> We see decreased activity. So there's a drop in rumination and rumor hyper motility. There's a decline in feed intake. There's a decline in water intake. There's a decline in general, physical activity. Many of the early herds where this have occurred have activity monitors on their animals, and monitors within the milking systems that show a decrease in yield and consistency. 
> 
> The milk itself becomes thicker, often yellowish to brown and resembling a gloster. Some animals are showing flakes in milk, which are generally an indication of mastitis.
> 
> Severe cows are affected in all quarters, but in some animals it's only one or two of the quarters, and so it's not in necessarily affecting the entire mammary gland. 
> 
> There is widespread increase in milk conductivity, again a monitor about milk quality.
> 
> These animals when they become sick, they are separated from the general herd as best as possible. As you can imagine on a farm with 2,000 cows, you have 200 or so animals that become sick and separating them out into the hospital area can be challenging, because the farms are not set up to anticipate having a consequence like this where 10% or so of the herd is having clinical symptoms.
> 
> When these animals are becoming clinically ill, there is no specific treatment for high path AI in dairy cattle. So they are being treated for symptoms. 
> 
> They are being-- animals are being drenched to help rehydrate them. When they have secondary symptoms like fever, they're being given NSAIDs or other other things to help with those symptoms. But there's no specific treatment regimen today for high path AI and dairy cattle. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Jamie Jonker, NMPF [00:55:25]
> 
> When a farm has an outbreak, the general timeline? It takes a little bit less than a week to peak incidence. 
> 
> So when this gets into the herd, it's rolling through very fast. We're having a tapering at about two weeks. And so it's also a very quick issue in the dairy farms. 
> 
> However, it does take around 30 to 45 days for those clinically infected cows to recover fully from the process. And that being said, we have some cows that do not fully recover milk production, in that month to a month and a half period. 
> 
> Some animals actually essentially shut down milk production from this and become a dry animal. We do not know if that is a lasting condition, until we start having some of these animals freshen back in to the herd. And that could be as much as six months from now. 
> 
> And so there's still a lot more to learn about the lasting impacts of this on some of the clinically infected animals. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Jamie Jonker, NMPF [00:56:39]
> 
> There have been some abortions associated with this, but that again has not been a consistent sign. 
> 
> That is a secondary issue that may or may not be directly related to high path AI, or could be related to a secondary infectious organism. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Jamie Jonker, NMPF [00:57:55]
> 
> So that initial introduction most likely comes from migratory birds. But the exact route of that will probably remain a bit of a mystery because it took six weeks or so to figure out that it was actually high path AI in the original affected herds. And so, being able to trace back to that precise spillover event may remain a bit of a mystery.
> 
> ...
> 
> Jamie Jonker, NMPF [00:58:21]
> 
> Cows don't fly, but we have had additional herds identified in seven other states after that initial announcement on March 25th. So that does mean that it is spreading in other areas in some capacity.
> 
> There have been some animal movements from the affected areas in Texas to several of those other states. And that may be one route of transmission that is still being investigated as part of the epidemiological investigation process. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Jamie Jonker, NMPF [00:59:01]
> 
> We are seeing this in our lactating animals, but we are not seeing this in our calves, our growing heifers, our pregnant heifers, or in dry cows that have been dry prior to infection in the herd. 
> 
> And so it's very unique displayed dairy animals, acting in the mammary gland, seemingly more like a mastitis than a respiratory issue that is more typical of an influenza. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Jamie Jonker, NMPF [00:59:50]
> 
> There have been one egg layer in Texas, three egg layers in Michigan, which have been confirmed to have high path AI H5N1, the same consistent genetic clade from the original, migratory bird introduction. 
> 
> Those farms have been in close proximity to affected dairy farms. And so there could be lateral flow from the dairy farms to these poultry operations, to these egg laying operations. This could be such things as transfer of the virus through fomites, such as on clothing or on vehicles. 
> 
> Again, we, this process is still unfolding. And so there is more research to be done to see if there has been this lateral flow from dairy farms to these operations. But this is changing how the dairy industry is looking at biosecurity on our farms. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [01:36:51]
> 
> Are there studies in process or direct studies of the impact of pasteurization on the virus in milk and questions about whether or not there should be concern about low temperature pasteurization in terms of safety of the milk supply. So wondering if you could comment on that quickly.
> 
> Jamie Jonker, NMPF [01:37:12]
> 
> That's an excellent question. Obviously there haven't been studies previously because this is the first time we've seen it in dairy cattle. 
> 
> And so, where we are today, the Food and Drug Administration believes that the varying interlocking on farm and in processing plant activities are keeping our milk supply safe. 
> 
> Part of that is the work that's been done on pasteurization and eggs. It's showing that pasteurization inactivates high path AI at about 60 degrees Celsius. 
> 
> Our most common pasteurization in the dairy sector is called high temperature, short time, that's at 70 plus Celsius. And then the practice of diverting milk from sick animals or normal milk from animals is another part to that. 
> 
> That being said, yes, there are-- there is research being done. FDA is working with USDA and land grant universities to answer these questions. What is the ultimate impact of pasteurization? And looking at things like where does the virus reside in the milk matrix? Looking at some of the technologies that are used such as reverse osmosis and other ultra filtration processes that are done in plants that separate out. And so that work is underway. 
> 
> We hope that information will be available shortly, and I'm not going to define what shortly is.
> 
> ...
> 
> Jamie Jonker, NMPF [01:40:49]
> 
> There's certainly a lot of serological work that's being done on clinical animals, animals that may be asymptomatic, work in other dairy animals that do not seem to be impacted. So, dry cows, springing heifers, young stock, this-- it's-- we have a lot more questions and answers, because we're still actually so early in this process. 
> 
> But there's a lot of great work being done by the many dedicated professionals across the U.S. on that.

## FDA commissioner on marijuana rescheduling at House hearing

> Rep Andy Harris [01:34:13]
> 
> I'm just going to ask one simple question. You know, it says that, one of the five part test, the drug must be accepted by qualified experts. And even under the two factor test, it says that a qualified expert organization have opined in favor and government agencies is one of them.
> 
> Did the FDA consult with Dr. Volkow at NIH. I mean, she is the head of the institute for drug abuse. Did you consult with her about the wisdom of rescheduling marijuana?
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [01:34:40]
> 
> NIDA has role in the process. And--
> 
> Rep Andy Harris [01:34:46]
> 
> This is a very specific question, doc. Did you discuss this with Dr. Volkow?
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [01:34:52]
> 
> The agency discussed it with NIDA. I'm not sure about the-- I talk with Dr. Volkow all the time so--
> 
> Rep Andy Harris [01:34:58]
> 
> And you're aware that she is adamantly opposed to making marijuana more broadly available and rescheduling it?
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [01:35:08]
> 
> I'm aware of her opinion, that she is.
> 
> Rep Andy Harris [01:35:09]
> 
> Okay, good. Because I would hope that we think that she is like the expert in the country on it, and I hope you would've taken that into consideration, but I suspect you took it in very minor considerations having come up with that recommendation, to reschedule marijuana. 
> 
> I just think-- I just think it's a dangerous move, and very uncharacteristic of the FDA, which deals with drugs. I would ask like which drug is it that you suggested rescheduling, THC, CBD combinations.

## Kentucky on case of counterfeit Botox

> Kentucky Department for Public Health is aware of one Kentucky resident who had botulism symptoms following injections of botulinum toxin A (known as Botox). This individual is recovering and investigations are ongoing. It is important for those who are considering botulinum toxin injections to seek a qualified medical provider who receives medication from a United States licensed manufacturer. Botulinum toxin A should only be injected by licensed physicians, physician assistants, nurses or dentists who have undergone specialized training in giving these injections.

## FDA commissioner addressing Chinese imports of vaping products

- **Date:** occurred April 18, 2024

> Robert Califf, FDA [00:38:06]
> 
> I'm a cardiologist and I practiced in North Carolina for 35 years. I probably have seen more people die from tobacco related illness than almost any physician because I was an intensivist who dealt with the end stage of the disease. This is a top priority for us. But when we make a final rule, it goes through an intensive interagency process. And that's where it is right now. I can't give details about dates at this point.
> 
> I'll just say from the point of view of the FDA and me as an individual, given what I've seen in my life, we're talking about over the next 30 years, probably 600,000 deaths that could be averted. And most of these as you duly note, are in African American people who have been targeted by the industry for the sale of these products. 
> 
> So I'm with you all the way, but I can't give details about the interagency process.
> 
> Rep Barbara Lee [00:39:09]
> 
> Okay. The interagency process is cumbersome. But I mean, we have an idea, some based on prior experience with rule making. Six months? A year? Three years? I mean, do you have a sort of a timeframe?
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:39:29]
> 
> Whatever decisions are made, this, you know this doesn't sit around for three years. But I can't give an exact time. I really am prohibited from doing that.
> 
> Rep Barbara Lee [00:39:40]
> 
> No time frame. I mean, do you think by the end of the year?
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:39:47]
> 
> It's one of our top priorities, so I would sure hope so.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:35:13]
> 
> I think we need to work with Congress to come up with a way to deal with this specific problem that cuts all of the red tape that we have to go through. Because if you think about it, it's not as if people don't see it coming in. It's just, if you went, I would urge you to go and just look, do a tour of the international mail facility, and see the work that has to go into documenting every single item that comes in. 
> 
> And there are many legal tricks that are used on the way in, like when I made my last trip to an import space, the boxes full of vaping products were labeled as lanterns. That creates a legal problem for us because we have to go by what's on the label. Then it takes weeks to get that fixed and through the legal process. And by then, there's a timeframe by which if we don't do something, the product goes on through.
> 
> And so, you know, my general theme, what I've come to realize, pardon the sports analogy, but at FDA we're like referees. We have a rule book, which you write as Congress. And I would at least urge you to think about this particular issue as one by which a specific rule might allow the referees to act quickly without all the things that are bogging us down.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:58:59]
> 
> I believe the solution to the problem is what we've already discussed. 
> 
> If there's one thing that seems to be bipartisan here, it's that these vaping products from China are not good for this country. They're not even -- they're flavored. They're not even sold in China to Chinese people. 
> 
> I think what we need is help from you to have a system that allows us to do this efficiently, to deal with it. There are 300,000 retail stores selling these products. We can't be in every one of them.
> 
> And let me just mention two things related to what you said.
> 
> Our budget is basically fixed, it hasn't grown. And we get no user fees from the vaping industry. It's totally-- the budget is totally funded by user fees. The vaping industry has gotten off scot-free from paying the user fees. So the money that we're spending to deal with the vaping industry is taken from other sources because there is no specific money to deal with the vapes.

> So we have a request in to have user fees that would allow us to put many more people on the ground. But again, as I've thought about this, a lot, particularly as this problem has grown, I think the solution needs to be something that gets rid of-- that makes it possible to move efficiently, to stop this before it gets into 300,000 retail shops.

I'm sort of thinking over the last few nights, it's not an administration policy at this point, but it just seems kind of obvious that if we're going to deal with this particular problem-- and I wanna distinguish it from other products like the pharmaceutical products where we can't just cut them off because they have benefits. Like I-- my hypertension is treated by generic drugs that originate in other parts of the world.

## CDC spokesperson on MPXV Clade Ib preprint

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson David Daigle
- **Date:** received April 17, 2024

> The preprint manuscript provides a more detailed look at the genetic signatures for the clade I mpox variant circulating in Kamituga, in South Kivu, DRC. It is important to note that this is a pre-print, meaning it has not yet undergone peer review, and it is possible that the information could change after formal peer review.
> 
> This virus and this outbreak were already previously shared in two preprint publications: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.05.24303395, March 5, 2024 and https://virological.org/t/novel-clade-i-genome-sequences-from-the-ongoing-mpox-virus-outbreak-of-kamituga-in-south-kivu-province-democratic-republic-of-congo/956 Feb 15, 2024. This strain was already previously reported to contain a deletion in a specific part of the genome that might impact how well the CDC Clade I test works. This strain is still expected to test positive using CDC’s nonvariola orthopox (NVO) test, which is the primary test being used to diagnose mpox in LRN and most commercial labs across the United States.
> 
> For labs also running Clade-specific testing, CDC recommends the NVO test be run alongside any clade-specific PRC tests. Any unusual findings (for example, an NVO positive but Clade II negative) would prompt a deeper look at the sequence to see if it might be due to Clade I.
> 
> CDC continues to receive and test samples from U.S. mpox cases diagnosed by the NVO test, and we are taking a deeper look at the clade and any mutations.
> 
> NO CASES OF CLADE I MPOX have been detected in the United States.

## Chicago official on measles vaccine failures in outbreak

- **Source:** webinar
- **Attribution:** hosted by the Big Cities Health Coalition
- **Date:** occurred April 16, 2024

> Massimo Pacilli, Chicago Department of Public Health [00:20:06]
> 
> The index case was early-- it was March 7th. We sort of immediately recognized it seated in a shelter that's housed around 1,800 individuals who are not sort of organized in family units. It's a large congregate setting. 
> 
> So lots of opportunities for individuals to be in the same space, and families and children to interact, and therefore continuous exposures.
> 
> In that setting, we recognized the immediate need to deploy vaccination so that, within the next three days, we were actually able to go on site and deliver nearly a thousand vaccines. And that sort of-- it takes about two weeks or 21 days to get sort of the full immunity benefit from those doses. But we certainly have seen the benefits in subsequent sort of infectious periods. 
> 
> And so initially in this setting, we saw sort of the result of there the initial exposures in a cluster of cases, and then a second wave with sort of a peak around March 24th, that represented probably the exposure of that first wave. So that represented a little bit the peak of cases presenting. 
> 
> And then after that, we are really are starting to see the benefit of those vaccinations. We've gone back and sort of deployed second doses, which is sort of-- they can be administered 28 days after the first. And we're really seeing the effect of this population being better protected and therefore less cases presenting.
> 
> We're down to this week we have yet to record a case. The last one was with a rash onset of last week. 
> 
> But again, hard to tell sort of the end of an outbreak, but we certainly see the protection of this community in this setting and sort of a-- we're certainly at the tail end of those cases presenting. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Massimo Pacilli, Chicago Department of Public Health [00:22:11]
> 
> I think the other question was related to individuals infected with measles who may have received a vaccine before. So, as I was saying, measles vaccine is quite protective, but again, no vaccine is sort of a hundred percent protective, although it's certainly even for those who end up being infected, there is sort of a lessening of the disease and a lessening of the spread that results from it. 
> 
> I think what's unique and why we see sort of a higher proportion of individuals who have received dose with measles in this setting is because-- like that's-- sometimes observed sort of in family units when the exposure is really intense, right? We have these family units where a kid is perhaps infected and then caretakers are really around the case continuously. 
> 
> Well, the situation is not that dissimilar in a large congregate setting. In this setting, we're observing continuing protracted exposures. And so it is not completely unexpected to see a higher proportion of individuals who may have had a dose end up being infected with measles. 
> 
> So I think that begins to explain sort of that proportion being a little bit different as the result of the uniqueness of the setting.

> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:07:46]
> 
> We saw this clinical syndrome kind of presenting in dairy cattle where dairy cattle would go off being, we would see decreases in their milk production, low grade fevers. That kind of is where this started as we started some of those conversations with the states. 
> 
> From there, we found the detection of the HPAI in some of the milk samples collected from those animals. 
> 
> It is still at this point, I would say unclear whether the underlying etiology really is HPAI in cattle causing this illness, or if the illness is predisposed in animals being able to pick up HPAI in their milk secretions. That's the piece that we're still really trying to understand. And that's the epi work that we're really leveraging with our field staff, and our state partners at this point. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:08:36]
> 
> From what we are seeing in that initial epi work, we're seeing some sort of lateral transmission possibly occurring within these herds.
> 
> At this point though, we're kind of thinking that may be more related to a mechanical transmission component that's happening, since this is really kind of isolated to those dairy animals at this stage. And predominantly it's isolated even further to those lactating dairy cattle. 
> 
> So we're really trying to go back onto some of these farms, look at the process in the milking parlor, really kind of hone in, is there a mechanical transmission happening that this is more related to like a mastitis type event of high path transmitted mechanically between cattle and a process? 
> 
> Our team's also been working heavily to create epi questionnaire that we're taking out to the field staff, taking out to these farms and better understand, how we see the HPAI moving within.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:11:23]
> 
> One thing of note, the cattle that do, uh, show this clinical syndrome do recover in one to two weeks is what we're being told and what we're actually seeing in the field. 
> 
> So even though there is that lateral transmission occurring within the herd, the herd usually clears the infection within one to three weeks. But again, not something that we really have a full understanding on. And are continuing to do some studies to better understand that.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USD [00:15:31]
> 
> The samples that we're used to testing are swabs. And, when we tested milk, the milk was a little bit more challenging for us to test. These cows, clinically, had very thick milk. 
> 
> They would go off feed and produce a very thick milk and it was very obvious they would segregate them into the sick pen. And, we would test that milk and have challenges with inhibition. 
> 
> So laboratories ended up having to dilute the milk and we've added some various enzymes. And one of the things that we've been using is molecular transport media that contains like guanidine thiocyanate to break up some of the material within milk, to be able for us to get accurate PCRs.
> 
> The CT values in the PCRs in milk have been remarkable. We've seen PCRs as with, as low of a CT value as 10, and typically are in the teens. So we occasionally may see a clinical cow with CT values in the 20, but most of the time they're in the teens.
> 
> When we've obtained, nasal swabs or respiratory samples from these cattle, we're not seeing those CT values. Most of the time, those swabs are negative. Occasionally we get CT values in the thirties, but we have not been able to successfully sequence or recover a virus yet from a nasal swab, although we suspect it's very early stages. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:17:37]
> 
> So when Dr. Lyon said that this is behaving differently, that is-- that is most likely the reason with those CT values in the milk. It, just makes sense that that is the fluid that is-- that that would allow for the most risk of transmission to cow to cow. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:24:39]
> 
> We don't know at this point, the mechanical transmission in fomites piece. It may be the same process. 
> 
> We're terming it mechanical transmission at this point, because if there is-- if it is spreading in the process of the milking parlor, it may be that on those fomites, whether it's the clothing, whether it's the gloves, towels, whether it's in the dipping cups, whether it's in the suction cups, that's the piece that we don't know. But we think there may be an active transmission occurring at that stage.
> 
> Again, as we continue to get more epi information, as we continue to get different details from the farms, we do hope that we'll be able to kind of hone in on, is it truly fomite or is it more specific to an actual active transmission process in the parlor.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:25:56]
> 
> I don't know that I would say cow to cow specifically, because we haven't seen any true indication that the cows are actively shedding virus and exposing it directly to other cows. 
> 
> As Dr. Robbe-Austerman said, we're not seeing a lot of CT counts in those nasal swabs that kind of indicate viruses actively there. And it's moving between the cattle that way, which again, so that's where we're really looking at as that lateral transmission piece of something is moving it within the herd. 
> 
> It may not be cow to cow specifically.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:28:17]
> 
> So the herd in Michigan had animals that came from the Texas. One of the Texas herds in Michigan cattle did end up having infection later on. 
> 
> Again, we don't necessarily know that the cow gave it to the other cow, or if there was that human intervention piece where there was a lateral transmission occurring through that milking process. 
> 
> So the cow may not have given it to the cow.
> 
> But there was a, there was a transmission that did take place in that lateral mechanical space.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:30:37]
> 
> Generally were seeing only about 10% of the milking herd really affected in a lot of these reported cases. And it's a very-- like there's not been any mortality shown in this. So we're looking at 10% of the herd affected and no real mortality associated.
> 
> Most cattle do respond within that one to two weeks span.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:33:03]
> 
> So this virus is 3.13 in the GenoFlu pipeline. 
> 
> It's not a common virus, but it's very much a descendant of the viruses that have been dominating the flyways in the Pacific and the central flyways at the United States.
> 
> The cow viruses so far have all been similar enough that it would be consistent with the single spillover event or a couple of very closely related spillover event events. 
> 
> We are not seeing any different viruses in the dairy cows that can't relate back. So, so far, we don't have any evidence that this is being introduced multiple times into the cows.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:34:46]
> 
> We're able to confirm the epidemiology when we know cows move from one affected farm to the next, we're able to see that evidence within the sequences. 
> 
> So again, it's very consistent to a single spillover event and then spread based on cattle movement. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:35:30]
> 
> We haven't formally developed some active surveillance plans around the peri-domestic wildlife in the barns and stuff, but that's planning. 
> 
> We have tested skunks on or near the premises. We have tested, you know, wild birds. And of course the cats on these dairies have been affected and. And the cats have a high level of mortality on these dairy farms, if they're-- and most of them we assume are being allowed access to some of this milk.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:37:10]
> 
> In fecal material, we have tested and the vast majority of those have been negative. Some have had very high CTs, but based on our experience, we would not be able to rule out contamination because they're being tested on the same plate as very hot milk.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:37:56]
> 
> We have really been encouraging our laboratories to be open to testing animals with clinical signs. 
> 
> We did have a laboratory go back in their archive and test samples from abortions, which as you know, many times abortions remain undiagnosed. 
> 
> And so they tested all the abortions submitted to their laboratory from January through March. And all of those were not detected. 
> 
> We have not had any reports of sick beef cattle, but we're confident that with our NAHLN laboratories, they would, if they did get a non-negative, they would send that to us. 
> 
> We have authorized testing for sick pigs and we, those so far, have all been non-negative, although there's-- sorry, all negative, although we have very limited samples yet collected from swine in the areas. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:41:23]
> 
> All I can say is so far with virus isolation, when we've tested whole blood, we are not detecting. 
> 
> So right now there's no evidence that we have that suggests that this virus is systemic at this point in time. So we're testing cows that have very low CT values in the milk, but their whole blood is negative. And that suggests that this virus has tropism for udder tissue and maybe the epithelial udder tissue. 
> 
> We don't know that yet, but right now we don't have evidence that the virus is actively replicating within the body of the cow, other than the udder.
> 
> ...
> 
> Christine Szablewski, CDC [00:44:07]
> 
> There have been some discussions about doing some studies to look at asymptomatic persons, to see if there's any kind of serologic evidence or even nasal canal infection in those farm workers. 
> 
> But right now, those are just discussions. 
> 
> What I can say is that when we first saw the outbreaks of high path AI in poultry herds, we did publish us do a seroprevalence study, and we did publish that and I will drop that into the chat.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:45:39]
> 
> I don't think that we have full clarity. 
> 
> We do have one dairy that had a confirmed poultry that have the same genotype. We have sequenced the poultry. 
> 
> There were no cows that were sequenced because we didn't know at the time. And so-- but that sequence is very consistent and like, it basically is that-- I don't want to call it an ancestral sequence because this virus collects snips fairly quickly, but it is very consistent. 
> 
> And all of the detection so far in cattle are clustered around that. 
> 
> What we know we need to do is try to figure out what virus within the clade and this genotype have the ability to infect mammary tissue in cows. And I think that's one of the hot topics that is being discussed among our scientists.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:47:48]
> 
> And again, we're seeing-- we're only seeing this occurring in those lactating dairy animals at this stage, which again, pushes it back into thinking that there's more of that lateral transmission occurring related to that milking process. 
> 
> And as Dr. Robbe-Austerman said earlier, well not seeing the virus really circulating systemically through the animals at this point, based on the samples that we do have, which again, kind of points back to there's that affinity to that mammary tissue pointing to that milking process, playing a larger role in the transmission than maybe some other pathways.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:58:57]
> 
> I do want to point out that our reported goat event that occurred in the state of Minnesota is a different genotype. And we did test milk in those goats and the milk was negative. So that genotype performed typically like we would expect, which is neurologic disease. 
> 
> So this virus is different. And so-- but we need to understand if this virus actually has a broader species tropism than just cattle. So there's a lot of questions that we're currently trying to answer. And it's a really broad effort.
