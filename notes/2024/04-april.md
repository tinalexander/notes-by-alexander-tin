- **Date:** occurred April 18, 2024

> Rep Andy Harris [01:34:13]
> 
> I'm just going to ask one simple question. You know, it says that, one of the five part test, the drug must be accepted by qualified experts. And even under the two factor test, it says that a qualified expert organization have opined in favor and government agencies is one of them.
> 
> Did the FDA consult with Dr. Volkow at NIH. I mean, she is the head of the institute for drug abuse. Did you consult with her about the wisdom of rescheduling marijuana?
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [01:34:40]
> 
> NIDA has role in the process. And--
> 
> Rep Andy Harris [01:34:46]
> 
> This is a very specific question, doc. Did you discuss this with Dr. Volkow?
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [01:34:52]
> 
> The agency discussed it with NIDA. I'm not sure about the-- I talk with Dr. Volkow all the time so--
> 
> Rep Andy Harris [01:34:58]
> 
> And you're aware that she is adamantly opposed to making marijuana more broadly available and rescheduling it?
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [01:35:08]
> 
> I'm aware of her opinion, that she is.
> 
> Rep Andy Harris [01:35:09]
> 
> Okay, good. Because I would hope that we think that she is like the expert in the country on it, and I hope you would've taken that into consideration, but I suspect you took it in very minor considerations having come up with that recommendation, to reschedule marijuana. 
> 
> I just think-- I just think it's a dangerous move, and very uncharacteristic of the FDA, which deals with drugs. I would ask like which drug is it that you suggested rescheduling, THC, CBD combinations.

> Kentucky Department for Public Health is aware of one Kentucky resident who had botulism symptoms following injections of botulinum toxin A (known as Botox). This individual is recovering and investigations are ongoing. It is important for those who are considering botulinum toxin injections to seek a qualified medical provider who receives medication from a United States licensed manufacturer. Botulinum toxin A should only be injected by licensed physicians, physician assistants, nurses or dentists who have undergone specialized training in giving these injections.

> The New York State Department of Health is not aware of any cases in New York State outside of New York City. Please contact the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene at pressoffice@health.nyc.gov to inquire about numbers within the City. The Department also encourages anyone who believes they may be impacted by the counterfeit product to contact their primary care physician and local health department.

## FDA commissioner addressing Chinese imports of vaping products

- **Source:** [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsfunubJ_Eo)
- **Attribution:** House Appropriations Committee hearing
- **Date:** occurred April 18, 2024

> Robert Califf, FDA [00:38:06]
> 
> I'm a cardiologist and I practiced in North Carolina for 35 years. I probably have seen more people die from tobacco related illness than almost any physician because I was an intensivist who dealt with the end stage of the disease. This is a top priority for us. But when we make a final rule, it goes through an intensive interagency process. And that's where it is right now. I can't give details about dates at this point.
> 
> I'll just say from the point of view of the FDA and me as an individual, given what I've seen in my life, we're talking about over the next 30 years, probably 600,000 deaths that could be averted. And most of these as you duly note, are in African American people who have been targeted by the industry for the sale of these products. 
> 
> So I'm with you all the way, but I can't give details about the interagency process.
> 
> Rep Barbara Lee [00:39:09]
> 
> Okay. The interagency process is cumbersome. But I mean, we have an idea, some based on prior experience with rule making. Six months? A year? Three years? I mean, do you have a sort of a timeframe?
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:39:29]
> 
> Whatever decisions are made, this, you know this doesn't sit around for three years. But I can't give an exact time. I really am prohibited from doing that.
> 
> Rep Barbara Lee [00:39:40]
> 
> No time frame. I mean, do you think by the end of the year?
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:39:47]
> 
> It's one of our top priorities, so I would sure hope so.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:35:13]
> 
> I think we need to work with Congress to come up with a way to deal with this specific problem that cuts all of the red tape that we have to go through. Because if you think about it, it's not as if people don't see it coming in. It's just, if you went, I would urge you to go and just look, do a tour of the international mail facility, and see the work that has to go into documenting every single item that comes in. 
> 
> And there are many legal tricks that are used on the way in, like when I made my last trip to an import space, the boxes full of vaping products were labeled as lanterns. That creates a legal problem for us because we have to go by what's on the label. Then it takes weeks to get that fixed and through the legal process. And by then, there's a timeframe by which if we don't do something, the product goes on through.
> 
> And so, you know, my general theme, what I've come to realize, pardon the sports analogy, but at FDA we're like referees. We have a rule book, which you write as Congress. And I would at least urge you to think about this particular issue as one by which a specific rule might allow the referees to act quickly without all the things that are bogging us down.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:58:59]
> 
> I believe the solution to the problem is what we've already discussed. 
> 
> If there's one thing that seems to be bipartisan here, it's that these vaping products from China are not good for this country. They're not even -- they're flavored. They're not even sold in China to Chinese people. 
> 
> I think what we need is help from you to have a system that allows us to do this efficiently, to deal with it. There are 300,000 retail stores selling these products. We can't be in every one of them.
> 
> And let me just mention two things related to what you said.
> 
> Our budget is basically fixed, it hasn't grown. And we get no user fees from the vaping industry. It's totally-- the budget is totally funded by user fees. The vaping industry has gotten off scot-free from paying the user fees. So the money that we're spending to deal with the vaping industry is taken from other sources because there is no specific money to deal with the vapes. 
> 
> So we have a request in to have user fees that would allow us to put many more people on the ground. But again, as I've thought about this, a lot, particularly as this problem has grown, I think the solution needs to be something that gets rid of-- that makes it possible to move efficiently, to stop this before it gets into 300,000 retail shops.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [01:01:03]
> 
> I do feel compelled just to point out, this is my opinion. I'm sort of thinking over the last few nights, it's not an administration policy at this point, but it just seems kind of obvious that if we're going to deal with this particular problem-- and I wanna distinguish it from other products like the pharmaceutical products where we can't just cut them off because they have benefits. Like I-- my hypertension is treated by generic drugs that originate in other parts of the world.
> 
> But flavored vaping products have no health benefit. And so it seems like there could be some agreement about how to efficiently take care of at least that problem. 
> 
> So, I'll continue to work on it and look forward to working with you, whatever the right solution is.

## CDC spokesperson on MPXV Clade Ib preprint

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson David Daigle
- **Date:** received April 17, 2024

> The preprint manuscript provides a more detailed look at the genetic signatures for the clade I mpox variant circulating in Kamituga, in South Kivu, DRC. It is important to note that this is a pre-print, meaning it has not yet undergone peer review, and it is possible that the information could change after formal peer review.
> 
> This virus and this outbreak were already previously shared in two preprint publications: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.05.24303395, March 5, 2024 and https://virological.org/t/novel-clade-i-genome-sequences-from-the-ongoing-mpox-virus-outbreak-of-kamituga-in-south-kivu-province-democratic-republic-of-congo/956 Feb 15, 2024. This strain was already previously reported to contain a deletion in a specific part of the genome that might impact how well the CDC Clade I test works. This strain is still expected to test positive using CDC’s nonvariola orthopox (NVO) test, which is the primary test being used to diagnose mpox in LRN and most commercial labs across the United States.
> 
> For labs also running Clade-specific testing, CDC recommends the NVO test be run alongside any clade-specific PRC tests. Any unusual findings (for example, an NVO positive but Clade II negative) would prompt a deeper look at the sequence to see if it might be due to Clade I.
> 
> CDC continues to receive and test samples from U.S. mpox cases diagnosed by the NVO test, and we are taking a deeper look at the clade and any mutations.
> 
> NO CASES OF CLADE I MPOX have been detected in the United States.

## Chicago official on measles vaccine failures in outbreak

- **Source:** webinar
- **Attribution:** hosted by the Big Cities Health Coalition
- **Date:** occurred April 16, 2024

> Massimo Pacilli, Chicago Department of Public Health [00:20:06]
> 
> The index case was early-- it was March 7th. We sort of immediately recognized it seated in a shelter that's housed around 1,800 individuals who are not sort of organized in family units. It's a large congregate setting. 
> 
> So lots of opportunities for individuals to be in the same space, and families and children to interact, and therefore continuous exposures.
> 
> In that setting, we recognized the immediate need to deploy vaccination so that, within the next three days, we were actually able to go on site and deliver nearly a thousand vaccines. And that sort of-- it takes about two weeks or 21 days to get sort of the full immunity benefit from those doses. But we certainly have seen the benefits in subsequent sort of infectious periods. 
> 
> And so initially in this setting, we saw sort of the result of there the initial exposures in a cluster of cases, and then a second wave with sort of a peak around March 24th, that represented probably the exposure of that first wave. So that represented a little bit the peak of cases presenting. 
> 
> And then after that, we are really are starting to see the benefit of those vaccinations. We've gone back and sort of deployed second doses, which is sort of-- they can be administered 28 days after the first. And we're really seeing the effect of this population being better protected and therefore less cases presenting.
> 
> We're down to this week we have yet to record a case. The last one was with a rash onset of last week. 
> 
> But again, hard to tell sort of the end of an outbreak, but we certainly see the protection of this community in this setting and sort of a-- we're certainly at the tail end of those cases presenting. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Massimo Pacilli, Chicago Department of Public Health [00:22:11]
> 
> I think the other question was related to individuals infected with measles who may have received a vaccine before. So, as I was saying, measles vaccine is quite protective, but again, no vaccine is sort of a hundred percent protective, although it's certainly even for those who end up being infected, there is sort of a lessening of the disease and a lessening of the spread that results from it. 
> 
> I think what's unique and why we see sort of a higher proportion of individuals who have received dose with measles in this setting is because-- like that's-- sometimes observed sort of in family units when the exposure is really intense, right? We have these family units where a kid is perhaps infected and then caretakers are really around the case continuously. 
> 
> Well, the situation is not that dissimilar in a large congregate setting. In this setting, we're observing continuing protracted exposures. And so it is not completely unexpected to see a higher proportion of individuals who may have had a dose end up being infected with measles. 
> 
> So I think that begins to explain sort of that proportion being a little bit different as the result of the uniqueness of the setting.

> When was the earliest case reported who received the counterfeits?
> 
> CDC consults on patients who experience signs and symptoms consistent with botulism through our botulism consultation line all the time, but CDC saw an increase in consultations related to botulinum toxin injections in 2024. CDC began hearing reports of potentially counterfeit product in late March and started coordinating the multistate investigation last week.

> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:07:46]
> 
> We saw this clinical syndrome kind of presenting in dairy cattle where dairy cattle would go off being, we would see decreases in their milk production, low grade fevers. That kind of is where this started as we started some of those conversations with the states. 
> 
> From there, we found the detection of the HPAI in some of the milk samples collected from those animals. 
> 
> It is still at this point, I would say unclear whether the underlying etiology really is HPAI in cattle causing this illness, or if the illness is predisposed in animals being able to pick up HPAI in their milk secretions. That's the piece that we're still really trying to understand. And that's the epi work that we're really leveraging with our field staff, and our state partners at this point. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:08:36]
> 
> From what we are seeing in that initial epi work, we're seeing some sort of lateral transmission possibly occurring within these herds.
> 
> At this point though, we're kind of thinking that may be more related to a mechanical transmission component that's happening, since this is really kind of isolated to those dairy animals at this stage. And predominantly it's isolated even further to those lactating dairy cattle. 
> 
> So we're really trying to go back onto some of these farms, look at the process in the milking parlor, really kind of hone in, is there a mechanical transmission happening that this is more related to like a mastitis type event of high path transmitted mechanically between cattle and a process? 
> 
> Our team's also been working heavily to create epi questionnaire that we're taking out to the field staff, taking out to these farms and better understand, how we see the HPAI moving within.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:11:23]
> 
> One thing of note, the cattle that do, uh, show this clinical syndrome do recover in one to two weeks is what we're being told and what we're actually seeing in the field. 
> 
> So even though there is that lateral transmission occurring within the herd, the herd usually clears the infection within one to three weeks. But again, not something that we really have a full understanding on. And are continuing to do some studies to better understand that.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USD [00:15:31]
> 
> The samples that we're used to testing are swabs. And, when we tested milk, the milk was a little bit more challenging for us to test. These cows, clinically, had very thick milk. 
> 
> They would go off feed and produce a very thick milk and it was very obvious they would segregate them into the sick pen. And, we would test that milk and have challenges with inhibition. 
> 
> So laboratories ended up having to dilute the milk and we've added some various enzymes. And one of the things that we've been using is molecular transport media that contains like guanidine thiocyanate to break up some of the material within milk, to be able for us to get accurate PCRs.
> 
> The CT values in the PCRs in milk have been remarkable. We've seen PCRs as with, as low of a CT value as 10, and typically are in the teens. So we occasionally may see a clinical cow with CT values in the 20, but most of the time they're in the teens.
> 
> When we've obtained, nasal swabs or respiratory samples from these cattle, we're not seeing those CT values. Most of the time, those swabs are negative. Occasionally we get CT values in the thirties, but we have not been able to successfully sequence or recover a virus yet from a nasal swab, although we suspect it's very early stages. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:17:37]
> 
> So when Dr. Lyon said that this is behaving differently, that is-- that is most likely the reason with those CT values in the milk. It, just makes sense that that is the fluid that is-- that that would allow for the most risk of transmission to cow to cow. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:24:39]
> 
> We don't know at this point, the mechanical transmission in fomites piece. It may be the same process. 
> 
> We're terming it mechanical transmission at this point, because if there is-- if it is spreading in the process of the milking parlor, it may be that on those fomites, whether it's the clothing, whether it's the gloves, towels, whether it's in the dipping cups, whether it's in the suction cups, that's the piece that we don't know. But we think there may be an active transmission occurring at that stage.
> 
> Again, as we continue to get more epi information, as we continue to get different details from the farms, we do hope that we'll be able to kind of hone in on, is it truly fomite or is it more specific to an actual active transmission process in the parlor.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:25:56]
> 
> I don't know that I would say cow to cow specifically, because we haven't seen any true indication that the cows are actively shedding virus and exposing it directly to other cows. 
> 
> As Dr. Robbe-Austerman said, we're not seeing a lot of CT counts in those nasal swabs that kind of indicate viruses actively there. And it's moving between the cattle that way, which again, so that's where we're really looking at as that lateral transmission piece of something is moving it within the herd. 
> 
> It may not be cow to cow specifically.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:28:17]
> 
> So the herd in Michigan had animals that came from the Texas. One of the Texas herds in Michigan cattle did end up having infection later on. 
> 
> Again, we don't necessarily know that the cow gave it to the other cow, or if there was that human intervention piece where there was a lateral transmission occurring through that milking process. 
> 
> So the cow may not have given it to the cow.
> 
> But there was a, there was a transmission that did take place in that lateral mechanical space.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:30:37]
> 
> Generally were seeing only about 10% of the milking herd really affected in a lot of these reported cases. And it's a very-- like there's not been any mortality shown in this. So we're looking at 10% of the herd affected and no real mortality associated.
> 
> Most cattle do respond within that one to two weeks span.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:33:03]
> 
> So this virus is 3.13 in the GenoFlu pipeline. 
> 
> It's not a common virus, but it's very much a descendant of the viruses that have been dominating the flyways in the Pacific and the central flyways at the United States.
> 
> The cow viruses so far have all been similar enough that it would be consistent with the single spillover event or a couple of very closely related spillover event events. 
> 
> We are not seeing any different viruses in the dairy cows that can't relate back. So, so far, we don't have any evidence that this is being introduced multiple times into the cows.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:34:46]
> 
> We're able to confirm the epidemiology when we know cows move from one affected farm to the next, we're able to see that evidence within the sequences. 
> 
> So again, it's very consistent to a single spillover event and then spread based on cattle movement. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:35:30]
> 
> We haven't formally developed some active surveillance plans around the peri-domestic wildlife in the barns and stuff, but that's planning. 
> 
> We have tested skunks on or near the premises. We have tested, you know, wild birds. And of course the cats on these dairies have been affected and. And the cats have a high level of mortality on these dairy farms, if they're-- and most of them we assume are being allowed access to some of this milk.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:37:10]
> 
> In fecal material, we have tested and the vast majority of those have been negative. Some have had very high CTs, but based on our experience, we would not be able to rule out contamination because they're being tested on the same plate as very hot milk.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:37:56]
> 
> We have really been encouraging our laboratories to be open to testing animals with clinical signs. 
> 
> We did have a laboratory go back in their archive and test samples from abortions, which as you know, many times abortions remain undiagnosed. 
> 
> And so they tested all the abortions submitted to their laboratory from January through March. And all of those were not detected. 
> 
> We have not had any reports of sick beef cattle, but we're confident that with our NAHLN laboratories, they would, if they did get a non-negative, they would send that to us. 
> 
> We have authorized testing for sick pigs and we, those so far, have all been non-negative, although there's-- sorry, all negative, although we have very limited samples yet collected from swine in the areas. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:41:23]
> 
> All I can say is so far with virus isolation, when we've tested whole blood, we are not detecting. 
> 
> So right now there's no evidence that we have that suggests that this virus is systemic at this point in time. So we're testing cows that have very low CT values in the milk, but their whole blood is negative. And that suggests that this virus has tropism for udder tissue and maybe the epithelial udder tissue. 
> 
> We don't know that yet, but right now we don't have evidence that the virus is actively replicating within the body of the cow, other than the udder.
> 
> ...
> 
> Christine Szablewski, CDC [00:44:07]
> 
> There have been some discussions about doing some studies to look at asymptomatic persons, to see if there's any kind of serologic evidence or even nasal canal infection in those farm workers. 
> 
> But right now, those are just discussions. 
> 
> What I can say is that when we first saw the outbreaks of high path AI in poultry herds, we did publish us do a seroprevalence study, and we did publish that and I will drop that into the chat.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:45:39]
> 
> I don't think that we have full clarity. 
> 
> We do have one dairy that had a confirmed poultry that have the same genotype. We have sequenced the poultry. 
> 
> There were no cows that were sequenced because we didn't know at the time. And so-- but that sequence is very consistent and like, it basically is that-- I don't want to call it an ancestral sequence because this virus collects snips fairly quickly, but it is very consistent. 
> 
> And all of the detection so far in cattle are clustered around that. 
> 
> What we know we need to do is try to figure out what virus within the clade and this genotype have the ability to infect mammary tissue in cows. And I think that's one of the hot topics that is being discussed among our scientists.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mark Lyons, USDA [00:47:48]
> 
> And again, we're seeing-- we're only seeing this occurring in those lactating dairy animals at this stage, which again, pushes it back into thinking that there's more of that lateral transmission occurring related to that milking process. 
> 
> And as Dr. Robbe-Austerman said earlier, well not seeing the virus really circulating systemically through the animals at this point, based on the samples that we do have, which again, kind of points back to there's that affinity to that mammary tissue pointing to that milking process, playing a larger role in the transmission than maybe some other pathways.
> 
> ...
> 
> Suelee Robbe-Austerman, USDA [00:58:57]
> 
> I do want to point out that our reported goat event that occurred in the state of Minnesota is a different genotype. And we did test milk in those goats and the milk was negative. So that genotype performed typically like we would expect, which is neurologic disease. 
> 
> So this virus is different. And so-- but we need to understand if this virus actually has a broader species tropism than just cattle. So there's a lot of questions that we're currently trying to answer. And it's a really broad effort.

> The patient worked directly with sick cows at a dairy, so the virus was most likely transmitted through that close contact. We are working with other agencies to provide guidance to dairies about precautions they and their workers can take to minimize the risk of transmission from animals, and we are asking dairies to encourage workers who are sick to get tested.
