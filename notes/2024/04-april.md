> The patient worked directly with sick cows at a dairy, so the virus was most likely transmitted through that close contact. We are working with other agencies to provide guidance to dairies about precautions they and their workers can take to minimize the risk of transmission from animals, and we are asking dairies to encourage workers who are sick to get tested.
