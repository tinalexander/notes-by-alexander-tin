## HHS spokesperson on [GenBank submission of SARS-CoV-2](https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/e-and-c-investigation-uncovers-earliest-known-sars-co-v-2-sequence-released-outside-of-china) by Lili Ren 

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson
- **Date:** received January 17, 2024

> “The submission in question was unable to be verified, despite follow-ups by NIH to the Chinese scientist for more information and a response. While waiting for the submitter to provide information to verify the sequence, another submission of a nearly identical sequence but with verifiable details was submitted to GenBank by another group and verified for inclusion on January 12, 2020, providing the genetic sequence for SARS-CoV-2. This publicly available information was what was used by NIH scientists and others in their work to understand the origins of COVID-19.
> 
> “We agree that valuable, bipartisan work remains to address the Chinese government's lack of transparency and ensure investigators can access critical information about the origin of COVID-19, so we can better understand how to prevent future pandemics.
>  
> “HHS has consistently and voluntarily provided Congress with thousands of pages of documents, as well as the expertise of officials, as part of its effort to promote transparency and understanding on the origins of COVID-19.”

> Meghan Pennini, ASPR [00:14:10]
> 
> Bottom line is no one should be paying full price for Paxlovid. There are programs in place to ensure that, unless they choose to right, if somebody wants to pay, of course they can, if they don't want to enroll or they don't want to leverage these programs, they can. But we really want to emphasize that the best way to make sure, especially as everybody's getting educated and, things are ramping up, the best way to ensure that you really get the best no cost or very low cost Paxlovid is that you enroll ahead of time, right? 
> 
> You go to the webpage, you'll be directed to which program is right for you, and you walk into the pharmacy with the paperwork that says this is the program I fall under, and this is how I get my product. 
> 
> So of course it can also happen at the pharmacy counter, right, where things are, are ramping up and, payers and pharmacies are getting all on board. 
> 
> But again, the best way to just ensure, especially in this time period, is to take that initiative for your patient. You know, we want providers to be aware of that. We want the public to be aware of that. We want the pharmacies, everybody right across the board to be aware of that program. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Meghan Pennini, ASPR [00:19:39]
> 
> Just to go back to the point of the patient journey, and we appreciate right that we want to make this as seamless as possible. We also want to make sure that there's broad access. And so that's why we set up these programs.
> 
> But just to be clear, it should work at the counter. That's the goal. We're trying to make sure that gets implemented, so it's a seamless process for the patient, but again, especially in this time of transition, it's good to take the initiative when you can, and do that enrollment ahead of time. 
> 
> But, but I just-- I don't want to belittle the efforts, monumental efforts, that our pharmacy teams and payer teams are doing to make this a seamless process sort of on the back end, so patients don't even notice.
>

> Question [00:23:43]
> 
> With Paxcess, what are you seeing in terms of enrollment? Is the participation where you would like it to be?
> 
> Meghan Pennini, ASPR [00:23:52]
> 
> Yeah, so I can say, it's still in early days.
> 
> What I didn't get a chance to mention, and thank you for the opportunity, is there still is a lot of fully free USG distributed product out there sitting in pharmacies. And so, it will take a little bit of time. 
> 
> It's millions of patient courses. So it will take time for that to get used up, which is great, right? You can still find places where you can get absolutely free, no enrollment, nothing, product. And so until that really is drawn down, we won't start to see these other programs being leveraged as heavily. 
> 
> But I will say we know that it's being used now. It's really in the-- but not to the full extent, because obviously there's still this EUA product and people are being advised to use that up first, and then transition to the commercial product, which then you have to start leveraging these programs. 
> 
> So we know it works, but it's not getting used in high volumes as expected, because we're still using that fully free USG distributed product.

> Nirsevimab Administration
> 
> A huge thank you to all clinics administering nirsevimab. Despite the challenges and limited allocations, almost 50% of infants younger than 8 months have been immunized against RSV. Thank you for helping protect the most vulnerable. Beginning January 10, CDC will post monthly national estimates of nirsevimab receipt among children <8 months on RSVVaxView | CDC.  These will be based on parental report from the National Immunization Survey.
> 
> If your clinic still has doses on hand, please administer them. We are over halfway through the RSV season and doses administered now will offer the most protection to babies.

- **Date:** received January 8, 2024

> Paxlovid, an oral antiviral for COVID-19, is now available on the commercial market and the U.S. Government is winding down distribution of free oral antivirals. Medicare Part D enrollees can still obtain free Paxlovid through two pathways, either through their Part D plans or through Paxcess, Pfizer’s patient assistance program.
> 
> Has Medicare conducted any outreach to beneficiaries regarding eligibility for the Paxcess program for Paxlovid?
> 
> CMS and HHS continue to conduct outreach to our pharmacy, Part D sponsor, and pharmacy benefit manager partners to ensure smooth access to Paxlovid for Medicare enrollees. 
> 
> Are Part D plans required to inform members of the option
> 
> CMS encourages Part D sponsors to provide education and outreach to their enrollees and network pharmacies regarding whether the Part D sponsor will contract with Pfizer to offer Paxlovid at $0 cost sharing through the Part D plan, or instead, encourage enrollees and network pharmacies to utilize the standalone USG PAP operated by Pfizer.
> 
> For more information, please see the attached January 4, 2024 memo from CMS to Part D sponsors.

> Following rigorous study for many years in clinical trials and a robust approval process, medicines continue to be monitored by the FDA and manufacturer for safety. When the FDA identifies a potential safety issue, it creates a Newly Identified Safety Signal (NISS) for evaluation. Currently, the FDA is reviewing data on certain potential risks for GLP-1 receptor agonist medicines.  Patient safety is our priority, and we are collaborating with the FDA on these potential signals.

- **Date:** received January 3, 2024

> The FDA monitors the safety of drugs throughout their life cycle, including post-approval. In addition, the FDA maintains a system of postmarketing surveillance and risk assessment programs to identify and evaluate adverse events that did not appear during the drug development process. If newly identified safety signals are identified, the FDA will determine what, if any, actions are appropriate after a thorough review of available data.

## Novo Nordisk spokesperson on FAERS reports and semaglutide

- **Date:** received January 3, 2024

> Patient safety is the top priority for Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk works closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to continuously monitor the safety of all of our GLP-1RA medicines. We are aware that, as part of those monitoring efforts, FDA is evaluating several potential signals related to GLP-1RA medicines and has posted information about those ongoing assessments on its website. As FDA stated on its website, “The appearance of a drug on this list does not mean that FDA has concluded that the drug has the listed risk. It means that FDA has identified a potential safety issue, but it does not mean that FDA has identified a causal relationship between the drug and the listed risk.” The known risks associated with use of those medicines are reflected in their current FDA-approved product labeling. Novo Nordisk stands behind the safety and efficacy of all of our GLP-1RA medicines when they are used as indicated and when they are taken under the care of a licensed healthcare professional.

> it’s not just the cans that were produced around the same time that turned up no signs of contamination.  All tests conducted by the FDA have been negative, including the sample from the batch made for Israel.
> 
> ...
>  
> The FDA has also conducted an inspection at the facility where both the batches were produced, including collecting environmental samples .  All tests performed by the FDA were negative. The factory continues to operate at full capacity.   However, Reckitt/Mead Johnson understands the incredible responsibility we have in providing what is often the sole nutrition for infants, and there can be no short cuts for this vulnerable population – therefore, we chose to recall select batches of Nutramigen out of an abundance of caution.  Parents should be reassured that they can continue to feed their infants with Reckitt/Mead Johnson Nutrition products, including other Nutramigen powder formula batches, with confidence.
