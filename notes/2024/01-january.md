The factory continues to operate at full capacity.   However, Reckitt/Mead Johnson understands the incredible responsibility we have in providing what is often the sole nutrition for infants, and there can be no short cuts for this vulnerable population – therefore, we chose to recall select batches of Nutramigen out of an abundance of caution.  Parents should be reassured that they can continue to feed their infants with Reckitt/Mead Johnson Nutrition products, including other Nutramigen powder formula batches, with confidence.

> We are continuing to advance our long-acting antibody AZD3152 to help protect vulnerable patients like the immunocompromised who face up to 14x greater risk of hospitalisation from COVID-19 than the general population, even after repeated doses of COVID-19 vaccines.   
> 
> The Phase III efficacy trial is now fully enrolled; the trial will assess the potential benefit of AZD3152 in protecting immunocompromised patients in an environment with many variants in circulation. 
> 
> We aim to make AZD3152 available as a new option for COVID-19 as quickly as possible subject to trial readouts and regulatory reviews.
