> We are continuing to advance our long-acting antibody AZD3152 to help protect vulnerable patients like the immunocompromised who face up to 14x greater risk of hospitalisation from COVID-19 than the general population, even after repeated doses of COVID-19 vaccines.   
> 
> The Phase III efficacy trial is now fully enrolled; the trial will assess the potential benefit of AZD3152 in protecting immunocompromised patients in an environment with many variants in circulation. 
> 
> We aim to make AZD3152 available as a new option for COVID-19 as quickly as possible subject to trial readouts and regulatory reviews.
