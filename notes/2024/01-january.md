> The FDA monitors the safety of drugs throughout their life cycle, including post-approval. In addition, the FDA maintains a system of postmarketing surveillance and risk assessment programs to identify and evaluate adverse events that did not appear during the drug development process. If newly identified safety signals are identified, the FDA will determine what, if any, actions are appropriate after a thorough review of available data.

> Patient safety is the top priority for Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk works closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to continuously monitor the safety of all of our GLP-1RA medicines. We are aware that, as part of those monitoring efforts, FDA is evaluating several potential signals related to GLP-1RA medicines and has posted information about those ongoing assessments on its website. As FDA stated on its website, “The appearance of a drug on this list does not mean that FDA has concluded that the drug has the listed risk. It means that FDA has identified a potential safety issue, but it does not mean that FDA has identified a causal relationship between the drug and the listed risk.” The known risks associated with use of those medicines are reflected in their current FDA-approved product labeling. Novo Nordisk stands behind the safety and efficacy of all of our GLP-1RA medicines when they are used as indicated and when they are taken under the care of a licensed healthcare professional.

> The FDA has also conducted an inspection at the facility where both the batches were produced, including collecting environmental samples .  All tests performed by the FDA were negative. The factory continues to operate at full capacity.   However, Reckitt/Mead Johnson understands the incredible responsibility we have in providing what is often the sole nutrition for infants, and there can be no short cuts for this vulnerable population – therefore, we chose to recall select batches of Nutramigen out of an abundance of caution.  Parents should be reassured that they can continue to feed their infants with Reckitt/Mead Johnson Nutrition products, including other Nutramigen powder formula batches, with confidence.
