## Response from Neptune Resources LLC about FDA warning

- **Source:** text messages
- **Attribution:** Chad Hueffmeier of Neptune Resources LLC
- **Date:** received January 24, 2024

> Neptune Resources LLC did NOT have a single serious injure/illness reported.  Every serious illness reported was from a counterfeit product made by a New York-based company called Super Chill.
> 
> My understanding is that their counterfeit product did NOT even contain tianeptine as the label indicated; instead it contained one of the new synthetic cannabinoids and bromazepam.
> 
> I have plenty of proof that Super Chill is the manufacturer of the counterfeit products that have hurt people but I have had difficulty convincing the FDA to shift their attention to the counterfeiter.

## Massachusetts health department on applesauce lead poisonings

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** Massachusetts health department spokesperson
- **Date:** received January 23, 2024

> On Background:
> 
> In response to the lead-tainted applesauce recall, the Department of Public Health (DPH) Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (CLPPP) last year conducted targeted outreach to warn parents not to buy or use recalled lead-tainted applesauce puree pouches.
> 
> CLPPP sent out a notice on the Health and Homeland Alert Network (HHAN) to clinicians and local health departments, and informed DPH’s Women Infants and Children’s program and the Department of Early Education and Childcare about the recall.  
> 
> DPH’s Food Protection Program staff reviewed FDA’s inventory of Dollar Tree stores, where these products were sold, and worked closely with local boards of health to follow-up with various municipalities to track product removal from shelves.
> 
> Using CDC’s definition of potential cases, CLPPP case management staff identified five poisoned children potentially linked to consumption of the recalled products and reported the cases to CDC. CDC guidance recommends including cases where suspected consumption was within three months of the associated blood test; therefore, it’s difficult to determine if the potential exposure occurred before or after the recall announcement.

> Eduardo Azziz-Baumgartner, CDC [00:16:57]
> 
> In this map, you see changes in hospital admissions attributed to COVID 19. Green means that there's been a decrease compared to previous weeks, and orange means that there's been an increase in admissions, again, attributed to COVID 19, how much greener the map is on the January 13th cut.
> 
> So that's good news, that's compared to January 6th, hospitalizations. But they seem to have stabilized pretty much. And, we have to be careful though about making too many inferences about that because we could see an uptick again of cases, as adults return to work, after the holidays and children returned to school, after the winter holidays.
> 
> We have to wait and see.
> 
> Next slide, please. All right.
> 
> Let's see here, you see a steep flu COVID and RSV hospitalization rate that curbs up, per a hundred thousand population, in December. That seems to have come to a halt in those gray boxes. It seems to have stalled and halted. So it may be trending down that inflection point, however, it is within the gray bars, that gray box again of uncertainty. 
> 
> We have to wait to see if those trends, if that pattern continues, whether it continues to trend down, or if there's back filling of information that suggests that we're creeping up again after a little notch or divot on the curve. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Eduardo Azziz-Baumgartner, CDC [00:18:54]
> 
> Here on the table on the left and on the figure on the right, you'll notice that the percentage of available inpatient bed and ICU beds that are occupied, the encumbered beds, you can see in the purple line in that figure, the inpatient ward beds that are occupied by adults is close to 78% and with really little room for additional admissions. 
> 
> Similarly, you see in the green line, the inpatient beds that are occupied by children is at 69%, again, not a lot of room for additional admissions. 
> 
> And we're hearing from some jurisdictions in New England, for example, in Massachusetts, that they're really having a hard time with using all their bed capacity. 
> 
> Now, this is after a drop in the holidays in bed occupancy. This is not uncommon during the holidays, for the bed occupancy to go down a little bit again because of health utilization patterns. But we don't know if this is going to be a-- where the trend is going, where the pattern is going to go beyond the gray box of uncertainty. 
> 
> Again, what we know is that it has increased in the wards for both adults and children and, among adults in ICU beds, although the pediatric ICU admissions currently remains stable. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Eduardo Azziz-Baumgartner, CDC [00:22:18]
> 
> We really depend on biologic surveillance during the season to guide response, not only to from week to week to really tailor messages to the community, to fine tune how we respond to the viruses, not only at the local jurisdictions that you do with your own leadership, but here also at CDC and in other parts of HHS.
> 
> Now, it is important to note that one of the key measures that we track is for example, present positivity, percent of laboratory testing that turns out to be positive. We look for detection of novel viruses. You heard, of course, the JN.1 presentation from my colleague. 
> 
> And then, we also look for information that will help us with strain selection for what goes into the vaccines from these viral systems, and surveillance systems. And then we also look for antiviral resistance so that we can guide, help our clinicians stay informed about what antiviral work for which viruses and when they stop working as has happened historically, for flu for example.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:27:19]
> 
> Maybe you can address this is whether or not the symptoms with the new variant seem to be more severe or, or not?
> 
> Eduardo Azziz-Baumgartner, CDC [00:27:28]
> 
> Yeah, that's a really important question. And it looks like from the deep surveillance systems that are going that these electronic medical record cohorts and whatnot, there are early signals that that may not be the case, but we don't know yet. 
> 
> And so we're going to have increase-- the data's going to accrue during the next couple weeks, and hopefully we'll be able to get a better information out to our colleagues about the severity of JN.1. It doesn't look like it, it doesn't look like it. 
> 
> Now, it's important to remember that how a virus affects an individual is a unique-- an n of one, right? It could be very severe. People could die from a virus that, to the general population, may be milder. But it can still. These viruses can kill.
> 
> It's important to remember. So please do contact medical providers if you need to, and take care of your people please.
> 
> ...
> 
> Eduardo Azziz-Baumgartner, CDC [00:31:31]
> 
> There is some preliminary data that suggests that co-infections may be associated with more severe disease, but the data's inconclusive. And, and I think we're still trying to understand this. 
> 
> And part of the reason that is complicated is because we rely a lot on observational data for these findings, because it's not a common occurrence, but let's get back to you on that, please.

## CDC spokesperson on new cases of applesauce lead poisonings

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson
- **Date:** received January 19, 2024

> The increase in case counts reflects newly reported cases, for which the time of applesauce consumption varies. There is still ongoing outreach to find new cases at this time, and communication efforts to spread awareness of the dangers of these products are focused on preventing future exposures. Additionally, FDA is working with retailers to ensure that all products have been removed from shelves, and they would be the appropriate contact for updates to the recall work.
> 
> CDC’s immediate recommendations are to avoid eating cinnamon-containing apple purée or applesauce products included in the FDA recall announcements. Anyone who may have eaten the affected products should talk with their healthcare provider and get a blood test for lead.

## Pfizer spokesperson on Paxcess program enrollment

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** Pfizer spokesperson
- **Date:** received January 16, 2024

> I can share that as of January 2, approximately 55,000 pharmacies are contracted and online with the ability to participate in the Patient Assistance Program. These pharmacies are represented across all 50 states and represent a significant portion of historical PAXLOVID volume. This includes retail chains such as CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Kroger, Costco, H-E-B, Albertson’s, Meijer at this time, along with a number of independent pharmacies across the country. Additionally, contracts are being signed and pharmacies coming online on an ongoing basis, so this number will continue to increase. And, if a patient seeks to fill the PAXLOVID prescription at a pharmacy not participating in the USG PAP, or if a pharmacy does not have PAXLOVID inventory, overnight shipping to the patient’s home is also available.

- **Date:** received January 17, 2024

> “The submission in question was unable to be verified, despite follow-ups by NIH to the Chinese scientist for more information and a response. While waiting for the submitter to provide information to verify the sequence, another submission of a nearly identical sequence but with verifiable details was submitted to GenBank by another group and verified for inclusion on January 12, 2020, providing the genetic sequence for SARS-CoV-2. This publicly available information was what was used by NIH scientists and others in their work to understand the origins of COVID-19.
> 
> “We agree that valuable, bipartisan work remains to address the Chinese government's lack of transparency and ensure investigators can access critical information about the origin of COVID-19, so we can better understand how to prevent future pandemics.
>  
> “HHS has consistently and voluntarily provided Congress with thousands of pages of documents, as well as the expertise of officials, as part of its effort to promote transparency and understanding on the origins of COVID-19.”

> Meghan Pennini, ASPR [00:14:10]
> 
> Bottom line is no one should be paying full price for Paxlovid. There are programs in place to ensure that, unless they choose to right, if somebody wants to pay, of course they can, if they don't want to enroll or they don't want to leverage these programs, they can. But we really want to emphasize that the best way to make sure, especially as everybody's getting educated and, things are ramping up, the best way to ensure that you really get the best no cost or very low cost Paxlovid is that you enroll ahead of time, right? 
> 
> You go to the webpage, you'll be directed to which program is right for you, and you walk into the pharmacy with the paperwork that says this is the program I fall under, and this is how I get my product. 
> 
> So of course it can also happen at the pharmacy counter, right, where things are, are ramping up and, payers and pharmacies are getting all on board. 
> 
> But again, the best way to just ensure, especially in this time period, is to take that initiative for your patient. You know, we want providers to be aware of that. We want the public to be aware of that. We want the pharmacies, everybody right across the board to be aware of that program. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Meghan Pennini, ASPR [00:19:39]
> 
> Just to go back to the point of the patient journey, and we appreciate right that we want to make this as seamless as possible. We also want to make sure that there's broad access. And so that's why we set up these programs.
> 
> But just to be clear, it should work at the counter. That's the goal. We're trying to make sure that gets implemented, so it's a seamless process for the patient, but again, especially in this time of transition, it's good to take the initiative when you can, and do that enrollment ahead of time. 
> 
> But, but I just-- I don't want to belittle the efforts, monumental efforts, that our pharmacy teams and payer teams are doing to make this a seamless process sort of on the back end, so patients don't even notice.

> 
> Meghan Pennini, ASPR [00:23:52]
> 
> Yeah, so I can say, it's still in early days.
> 
> What I didn't get a chance to mention, and thank you for the opportunity, is there still is a lot of fully free USG distributed product out there sitting in pharmacies. And so, it will take a little bit of time. 
> 
> It's millions of patient courses. So it will take time for that to get used up, which is great, right? You can still find places where you can get absolutely free, no enrollment, nothing, product. And so until that really is drawn down, we won't start to see these other programs being leveraged as heavily. 
> 
> But I will say we know that it's being used now. It's really in the-- but not to the full extent, because obviously there's still this EUA product and people are being advised to use that up first, and then transition to the commercial product, which then you have to start leveraging these programs. 
> 
> So we know it works, but it's not getting used in high volumes as expected, because we're still using that fully free USG distributed product.

> Nirsevimab Administration
> 
> A huge thank you to all clinics administering nirsevimab. Despite the challenges and limited allocations, almost 50% of infants younger than 8 months have been immunized against RSV. Thank you for helping protect the most vulnerable. Beginning January 10, CDC will post monthly national estimates of nirsevimab receipt among children <8 months on RSVVaxView | CDC.  These will be based on parental report from the National Immunization Survey.

> Paxlovid, an oral antiviral for COVID-19, is now available on the commercial market and the U.S. Government is winding down distribution of free oral antivirals. Medicare Part D enrollees can still obtain free Paxlovid through two pathways, either through their Part D plans or through Paxcess, Pfizer’s patient assistance program.
> 
> Has Medicare conducted any outreach to beneficiaries regarding eligibility for the Paxcess program for Paxlovid?
> 
> CMS and HHS continue to conduct outreach to our pharmacy, Part D sponsor, and pharmacy benefit manager partners to ensure smooth access to Paxlovid for Medicare enrollees. 
> 
> Are Part D plans required to inform members of the option
> 
> CMS encourages Part D sponsors to provide education and outreach to their enrollees and network pharmacies regarding whether the Part D sponsor will contract with Pfizer to offer Paxlovid at $0 cost sharing through the Part D plan, or instead, encourage enrollees and network pharmacies to utilize the standalone USG PAP operated by Pfizer.

> Following rigorous study for many years in clinical trials and a robust approval process, medicines continue to be monitored by the FDA and manufacturer for safety. When the FDA identifies a potential safety issue, it creates a Newly Identified Safety Signal (NISS) for evaluation. Currently, the FDA is reviewing data on certain potential risks for GLP-1 receptor agonist medicines.  Patient safety is our priority, and we are collaborating with the FDA on these potential signals.

## FDA spokesperson on FAERS reports and GLP-1 receptor agonists

- **Date:** received January 3, 2024

> The FDA monitors the safety of drugs throughout their life cycle, including post-approval. In addition, the FDA maintains a system of postmarketing surveillance and risk assessment programs to identify and evaluate adverse events that did not appear during the drug development process. If newly identified safety signals are identified, the FDA will determine what, if any, actions are appropriate after a thorough review of available data.

## Novo Nordisk spokesperson on FAERS reports and semaglutide

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** Novo Nordisk spokesperson
- **Date:** received January 3, 2024

> Patient safety is the top priority for Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk works closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to continuously monitor the safety of all of our GLP-1RA medicines. We are aware that, as part of those monitoring efforts, FDA is evaluating several potential signals related to GLP-1RA medicines and has posted information about those ongoing assessments on its website. As FDA stated on its website, “The appearance of a drug on this list does not mean that FDA has concluded that the drug has the listed risk. It means that FDA has identified a potential safety issue, but it does not mean that FDA has identified a causal relationship between the drug and the listed risk.” The known risks associated with use of those medicines are reflected in their current FDA-approved product labeling. Novo Nordisk stands behind the safety and efficacy of all of our GLP-1RA medicines when they are used as indicated and when they are taken under the care of a licensed healthcare professional.

The factory continues to operate at full capacity.   However, Reckitt/Mead Johnson understands the incredible responsibility we have in providing what is often the sole nutrition for infants, and there can be no short cuts for this vulnerable population – therefore, we chose to recall select batches of Nutramigen out of an abundance of caution.  Parents should be reassured that they can continue to feed their infants with Reckitt/Mead Johnson Nutrition products, including other Nutramigen powder formula batches, with confidence.
