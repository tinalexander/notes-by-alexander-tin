## CDC official on recent xylazine trends

- **Source:** Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity [webinar](https://emergency.cdc.gov/coca/calls/2024/callinfo_022924.asp)

- **Date:** occurred February 29, 2024

> Josh Schier, CDC [00:15:56]
> 
> The available limited evidence suggests that the presence of xylazine in drug samples and among testing results in overdose deaths is increasing. 
> 
> However, the numbers are relatively small compared to data on opioid overdose deaths, and therefore it's difficult to accurately determine and predict future trends. 
> 
> The national forensic laboratory information system, or NFLIS, was established in 1997 as a DEA led program. It systematically collects drug identification results and associated information from drug cases submitted to and analyzed by participating federal state and local forensic laboratories. It's yet another source of data that can be used for monitoring trends of drug samples where xylazine is detected. 
> 
> Interestingly, in the September 2023 report pictured here, there appears to be a downtick in xylazine reports, but this data is not separated out by region. And truthfully this could represent many things, including a transient drop for some unclear reason, could be due to reporting delays or possibly a new trend. Unfortunately, only time will tell. Next slide. 
> 
> Maryland's rapid analysis of drugs program is reporting a recent drop in the prevalence of xylazine among all drug samples tested, not just fentanyl. In addition, there appears to be wide variation in the number of drug samples testing positive for xylazine and range from 20 to 80%, and seems to be highly dependent on jurisdiction as well. Next slide.
