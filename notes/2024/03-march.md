> Question [11:55:34]
> 
> I wanted to start with COVID testing. Can you talk me through what the CDC's new recommendation there is? I mean, obviously at risk people, Paxlovid, that's important. But if I'm a young, vaccinated, healthy adult, is there any reason I should be paying for COVID tests at this point?
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [11:55:49]
> 
> Well, first I want to say that only 20% of adults got the updated COVID vaccine. And so, part of the reason we're doing this updated guidance is to simplify for folks, what are the most important actions that they can take? 
> 
> So we have core strategies and it starts with vaccination. Vaccination is what we're seeing keeps people out of the hospital and reduce deaths. So, I wanted to say that right at the top.
> 
> But in terms of testing, continues to be an option. Obviously we are offering free tests at COVID tests dot gov. And it's a good way, so if you are feeling sick, it is still important to know what you have, because you could get access to treatment. 
> 
> We have treatment for flu and COVID, and treatment can also save someone's life and also reduce the risk of long COVID. Right? We recognize that long COVID is also reduced by getting vaccinated and getting treatment.
> 
> Question [11:56:48]
> 
> And then so, sorry, so just to clarify then-- what is the new recommendation on testing? Is it the same as the old one or has it changed?
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [11:56:54]
> 
> So what we're saying is if you are sick, make sure you're staying home and testing is important so that you know what you have, right? So when you are sick, when you have symptoms, to test.
> 
> We also have testing guidance in there that says, yes, you could use tests to be proactive to protect those around you. So if you are going to visit grandparents, or someone who's immunocompromised, you can test proactively. 
> 
> Now, if it's positive, we see very few false positives, we know that you have COVID. But it is still possible to have a false negative. So it can be reassuring, but it is not a guarantee that you don't have COVID if you see a negative.
> 
> Question [11:57:41]
> 
> And then on masking, I'm assuming this means that those COVID hospitalization level recommendations are going away? What is--
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [11:57:48]
> 
> I was going to say, guidance is not going to tie to any specific colors or anything like that. We're trying to give folks broad tools that they can use to protect themselves, and then give them information about what's happening in their community. 
> 
> So we will continue to provide that data what's happening in community. But again, like we did this past season, we do it in a combined way across COVID, flu, and RSV because we want folks to protect themselves from all of them.
> 
> Question [11:58:19]
> 
> And so that means then, there isn't going to be like a threshold of, if COVID trends go above this point, you should probably wear a mask. It's just going to be kind of make your own judgment based on your risk factors? Is that what you're telling me?
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [11:58:31]
> 
> Right. Because it goes back to what the core strategies are, right. First, get vaccinated before the season even starts. Right? Which is protect yourself underlying. 
> 
> And then as you're seeing things, then yes, use additional layers of protection, as you move through the season, or again, if you're going to be around people who are more vulnerable, or if you personally are more vulnerable, make sure you're taking added precautions.
> 
> Question [11:59:00]
> 
> Can you tell me a little bit about what this means for places like hospitals or nursing homes? 
> 
> I'm sure you saw, this past season, we still saw hospitals -- there were some in my community that said, we checked the CDC COVID hospitalization levels, it's gotten to that point, we're going to start requiring masks. Is there gonna be new recommendations for them?
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [11:59:19]
> 
> So the guidance for healthcare settings, which includes long-term care, is not changing. This guidance is just for community recommendations.
> 
> Question [11:59:29]
> 
> And then, so just to clarify, then what should they be looking for this coming season to judge, when to require masking? Is it going to be emergency room visits? Just help me understand what that's gonna look like.
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [11:59:41]
> 
> I'd have to go back and look specifically at our hospital-- since it's not changing, sorry, that's not my focus for today. But we can follow up, Alex.
> 
> Question [11:59:50]
> 
> Okay. And then the last thing I wanted to ask you about is, you know, obviously changes in the future. 
> 
> I know that the hope is that people are going to be more likely to follow these recommendations. 
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [12:00:02]
> 
> That's right. 
> 
> Question [12:00:02]
> 
> What happens if they don't? I mean, is that something you guys are going to be monitoring? Is that something that you might change again in the future? Talk me through how you're thinking about that.
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [12:00:11]
> 
> Sure. Well, it's really important that we continue to monitor this virus. We are continuing to understand how it's changing and trying to stay ahead of it. This is the best guidance information that we have right now, given what we're seeing with the underlying data and evidence. If this virus changes significantly, for some reason, our tools are not working like our vaccines are not protective. If our treatment isn't working, if our tests aren't working, then we might need to have changes to this guidance. 
> 
> But, again, this is what we know right now. But we also know this virus changes. We have to continue to watch it. 
> 
> We did share, Alex earlier this morning that we are updating-- we anticipate an updated COVID vaccine for later this year. So we want folks now to start making a plan for the fall to get both.
> 
> Question [12:01:37]
> 
> If you wouldn't mind, just revisiting that. Can you tell me, do you expect that these recommendations are going to be easier to follow? I mean, is that one of your hopes about these changes? 
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [12:01:45]
> 
> Yes. That is foundational here. That we are taking this unified approach so things can be simpler and more likely to be followed. And if they're easier and more likely to be followed, then we're protecting everyone, right? So the folks who are more vulnerable were top of mind when we did this.
> 
> We want to make sure that folks have these simpler guidance that are more likely to be followed, and thus, helps protect everyone. But just so you know, we also have special special considerations for folks who are more vulnerable.
> 
> Question [12:02:20]
> 
> And then just the last thing I wanted to ask you before I let you go here.
> 
> You know that the CDC has been talking about these pan respiratory recommendations, I think since last year, maybe earlier. Talk me through why we couldn't see these changes happen last year? I mean, I saw in the background document, there's plenty of other countries that did, so why not last year? Why now?
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [12:02:40]
> 
> Yeah. And the answer is we looked at it last summer, and said, could we do this last summer? And we were starting to pull together the evidence and the data. And then what happened was we got one of the largest changes in the virus last August, you may remember there was a variant, 2.86, which was, had a lot of changes. 
> 
> And, we wanted to see if the trends would hold through another respiratory season. We wanted to see continued decreases in hospitalizations, decreases in deaths, even with that larger change in the virus. And then we saw the JN.1 variant on top of it, which made the virus very transmissible. 
> 
> But having gone through that now and seeing the trends sustained? That's what makes us-- brings us to, to this moment.

## FDA official on naltrexone shortage cause

- **Date:** received March 1, 2024

> On background, the shortage is due to increased demand the companies report they can’t currently meet. Supplies are anticipated to improve around Q2-Q3 as manufacturers acquire additional API and increase production output to meet demand.
> 
> As you noted, the naltrexone extended-release IM injection remains available, as well as other alternative agents. We’ll continue to monitor availability of these alternatives.

## CDC official on recent xylazine trends

- **Source:** Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity [webinar](https://emergency.cdc.gov/coca/calls/2024/callinfo_022924.asp)

> Josh Schier, CDC [00:15:56]
> 
> The available limited evidence suggests that the presence of xylazine in drug samples and among testing results in overdose deaths is increasing. 
> 
> However, the numbers are relatively small compared to data on opioid overdose deaths, and therefore it's difficult to accurately determine and predict future trends. 
> 
> The national forensic laboratory information system, or NFLIS, was established in 1997 as a DEA led program. It systematically collects drug identification results and associated information from drug cases submitted to and analyzed by participating federal state and local forensic laboratories. It's yet another source of data that can be used for monitoring trends of drug samples where xylazine is detected. 
> 
> Interestingly, in the September 2023 report pictured here, there appears to be a downtick in xylazine reports, but this data is not separated out by region. And truthfully this could represent many things, including a transient drop for some unclear reason, could be due to reporting delays or possibly a new trend. Unfortunately, only time will tell. Next slide. 
> 
> Maryland's rapid analysis of drugs program is reporting a recent drop in the prevalence of xylazine among all drug samples tested, not just fentanyl. In addition, there appears to be wide variation in the number of drug samples testing positive for xylazine and range from 20 to 80%, and seems to be highly dependent on jurisdiction as well. Next slide.
