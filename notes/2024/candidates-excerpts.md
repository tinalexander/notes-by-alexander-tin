> Donald Trump [16;05]
> 
> She's running on socialist price controls, banning gas powered cars and trucks, and private health insurance policies are gone.
> 
> ...
> 
> Donald Trump [16;44]
> 
> She wants to give free health care for millions of illegal aliens and give them all citizenship into the United States immediately.
> 
> And she then wants to sign them up for Medicare and Social Security.
> 
> ....
> 
> Donald Trump [40;04] 
> 
> Kamala Harris can't answer how she'd pay for any of her new, radicalized, liberal spending schemes that will bankrupt our country and do it quickly, destroy Social Security, destroy Medicare.
> 
> ...
> 
> Donald Trump [40;54]
> 
> No clue how she'd pay for free health care for illegals. She wants to give free health care to illegals. 
> 
> Now you want to stop people from coming into our country, the first thing you do, and you would have to do this immediately, no health care. We can't do that. We can't afford it. It's not sustainable.
> 
> But they're doing just the opposite. Come to America. Live the American dream.
> 
> We'll give your children free schooling, we'll give you free health care, we'll give you pensions, we'll put you into Social Security.
> 
> ...
> 
> Donald Trump [54;06]
> 
> But pharmaceuticals too. It's outside of this country. 95% we're reliant on various other countries.

## Biden in Chicago on August 20

- **Date:** August 20, 2024
- **Location:** Democratic National Convention in Chicago, IL
- **Source:** [livestream](https://youtu.be/33ePGy1G0kQ) by CBS News

> Joe Biden [27;39] 
> 
> More Americans have peace of mind that comes from having health insurance. 
> 
> More Americans have health insurance today than ever before in American history.
> 
> And after, as a young senator beginning to fight, we got in a fight for 50 years to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, we finally beat big pharma.
> 
> And guess who cast the tie breaking vote? 
> 
> Vice president, soon to be president, Kamala Harris. And now it's the law of land. 
> 
> Instead of paying 400 dollars a month for insulin, seniors with diabetes will pay 35 a month. 
> 
> The law we passed, already includes, starting in January, every senior's total prescription cost can be capped at 2,000 dollars, no matter how expensive the drugs they have.
> 
> And what we don’t focus on, and our Republican friends doesn't seem to understand, our reforms don't just save seniors money, they save the American taxpayers money.  
> 
> You know what we just passed saved? It saved 160 billion dollars over the next decade.
> 
> That’s not hyperbole. It’s because Medicare no longer has to pay those exorbitant prices to the big pharma.  
> 
> ...
> 
> Joe Biden [54;27] 
> 
> They'll keep taking on big pharma, making insulin 35 dollars a month, not just for seniors, but for everyone in America. 
> 
> And capping prescription drug costs at a total of 2,000 dollars, not just for seniors, but for everyone. 
> 
> And folks, that's going to save America, again, tens of billions of dollars.
> 
> ...
> 
> Joe Biden [57;08]
> 
> They'll protect Social Security and Medicare. 
> 
> Trump wants to cut Social Security and Medicare.
> 
> ...
> 
> Joe Biden [57;25]
> 
> And you know Trump will do everything he can to ban abortion nationwide. Oh he will. 
> 
> You know, Kamala and Tim will do everything they possibly can, that's why have to elect the Senate and the House, to restore Roe v. Wade.

## Harris in Raleigh on August 16

- **Date:** August 16, 2024
- **Location:** Raleigh, NC
- **Source:** [livestream](https://youtu.be/IbhXnF2Jo94) by campaign

> Kamala Harris [23;27]
> 
> As attorney general in California, I went after companies that illegally increased prices. Including wholesalers that inflated the price of prescription medication.
> 
> ...
> 
> Kamala Harris [26;02]
> 
> As president, I'll attack and take on the issue of the cost of health care. 
> 
> As attorney general, I took on insurance companies and big pharma and got them to lower their prices.
> 
> And together with President Biden, we've gone even further. 
> 
> We capped the price of insulin at 35 dollars a month and the total cost-- And the total cost of prescription drugs at 2,000 a year for seniors.
> 
> We let Medicare negotiate lower drug prices for seniors.
> 
> And just yesterday-- and just yesterday, we announced that we are lowering the price by up to 80% for 10 more life saving drugs.
> 
> And I pledge to continue this progress. 
> 
> I'll lower the cost of insulin and prescription drugs for everyone, with your support, not only our seniors, and demand transparency from the middlemen companies who use opaque practices to raise your drug prices and profit off your need for medicine.
> 
> Two months ago I announced that medical debt will no longer be used against your credit score. 
> 
> And I will work, as president, with states like here in North Carolina, Roy Cooper, thank you again, to cancel medical debt for more and more, millions more Americans.
> 
> As for Donald Trump, well he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which 45 million Americans rely on.
> 
> 45 million Americans rely on it for health care. That would take us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. 
> 
> We all remember what that was. And we're not going back. We're not going back.
> 
> And remember-- and this is why we're not going back, because we do remember, he tried to cut Medicare every year he was president, threatening a program that tens of millions of seniors count on.
> 
> And according to his Project 2025 agenda, he intends to undo our work to bring down prescription drugs, the cost of prescription drugs, and insulin costs.
> 
> Well, we've come too far to let that happen. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kamala Harris [37;33]
> 
> Two days ago, Donald Trump was here in North Carolina. 
> 
> He said he was going to talk about the economy. I think you all who watched, you know what I'm about to say.
> 
> But he offered no serious plans to reduce costs for middle class families. 
> 
> No plan to expand access to housing or health care. 

## Harris in Largo to overflow crowd on August 15

- **Date:** August 15, 2024

> Have you all seen that list that we published — (applause) — about the — what is going to be — anywhere from — I think it’s 40 to 80 percent reduction of cost for prescription medication.  (Applause.)  It’s extraordinary, and it has never happened before.

## Harris in Largo to event on August 15

- **Date:** August 15, 2024
- **Location:** Largo, MD
- **Source:** [transcript](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/08/15/remarks-by-president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-on-the-progress-they-are-making-to-lower-costs-for-the-american-people-largo-md/) by White House

> And why — we all know, but let’s ask — why are prescrips- — why are prescription drugs so expensive? 
> 
> AUDIENCE:  Why?
> 
> THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I will tell you.  (Applause.)  Well, one big reason is, for years, Big Pharma has often inflated the price of lifesaving medications —
> 
> AUDIENCE:  Booo — 
> 
> THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — often charging many times what it would cost to make, just to increase their profits.  And millions of Americans have suffered as a result. 
> 
> My entire career, I have worked to hold bad actors accountable and lower the cost of prescription drugs.  As attorney general of California, I took on pharmaceutical companies for deceptive marketing and illegally inflating the cost of drugs — (applause) — and we won billions of dollars. 
> 
> As a United States senator, I fought to pass laws that would make health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans. 
> 
> And as vice president, together with Joe Biden, our president — (applause) — we finally addressed the long-standing issue that for years was one of the biggest challenges on this subject, which was that Medicare was prohibited by law from negotiating lower drug prices, and those costs then got passed on to our seniors.  But not anymore.  (Applause.)
> 
> Two years ago, we gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for the first time in history.  (Applause.)  And here is why that matters: It is nearly impossible for a patient to negotiate lower prices by themselves.  Just think about that — somebody who needs the medication, who may be suffering from a serious illness, that they would by themselves be able to negotiate against a big drug company to lower their prices is virtually impossible.  It’s one person against a huge corporation. 
> 
> But Medicare represents more than 65 million people.  And so, Medicare has collective bargaining power.  And now Medicare can use that power to go toe-to-toe with Big Pharma and negotiate lower drug prices.  (Applause.)
> 
> ...
> 
> And this is to the benefit of not only tens of millions of people on Medicare but also millions of Americans on Medicare who have long-term disabilities.
> 
> And understand, as a result of our negotiations, the government will also pay less, then, for prescription drugs.  And think about what that means in terms of paying — helping taxpayers save money, whether or not they take these medications.

> And now, in state after state, laws have been proposed and passed to punish women, to criminalize doctors. 
> 
> You know, in Texas that law provides prison for life.  Understand what’s happening in our country: laws with no exception, even for rape or incest.
> 
> ...
> 
> And the reality is that if Donald Trump were to win this election, he would sign a national abortion ban.  And if a national abortion ban is in play, California and many other states that have protected the right will not be immune.

> 
> You remember what that was, like children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes. 
> 
> Look, America has tried these failed policies before and we are not going back. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kamala Harris [45;19]
> 
> We all know how we got here.
> 
> When he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court, because he intended for them to undo the protections of Roe v Wade.
> 
> And as he intended they did. Now in more than 20 states, there is a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest.
> 
> And be sure, if he were to win, he would sign a national abortion ban, which would outlaw abortion in every state, even Nevada.
