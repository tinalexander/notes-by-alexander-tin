## Michigan State University laboratory on H5N1 testing in dairy cattle

- **Date:** occurred May 7, 2024

> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:06:58]
> 
> So we're a pretty big laboratory. We have about 150 faculty and staff, and we run a million tests a year. Now the vast majority of that is routine testing. 
> 
> So again, we're an animal health laboratory. We support the MSU Veterinary Medical Center, which is the teaching hospital for the College of Veterinary Medicine. But we also support veterinarians and veterinary clinics across the state, actually around the country, and in 25 countries. So we do a lot of routine diagnostic testing. 
> 
> One of our areas of specialty is endocrinology. You might be aware that dogs and cats often have thyroid disease, for example. And so that all sits in our wheelhouse. 
> 
> So that's the vast majority of what we do on a daily basis, but at the same time, we are part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network or the NAHLN. That's a network of 63 academic state and federal laboratories that serves as the first line of defense in the case of incursion of a high consequence animal disease like high path AI. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:09:03]
> 
> So as members of the NAHLN, we are constantly preparing for potential disease outbreaks. We do tabletop and functional exercises in our state, in our region, and nationwide exercises as well. Our goal is always to understand what is the potential needs for diagnostic testing, going to be in the case of widespread outbreak and how do we ensure that we're prepared to ramp up that testing? 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:09:54]
> 
> So we're constantly looking to be able to rapidly detect an emergence of, again, a high consequence disease threat.
> 
> When that does happen, and we detect it, that's when we move into sort of outbreak response, which for us is surge capacity. It means ramping up high throughput testing to be able to provide rapid diagnostic test results to veterinarians, state and federal officials, industry as quickly as possible. 
> 
> That outbreak testing includes not only identifying additional facilities or premises that might be infected, but also being able to do active surveillance. So for example, when we know we have a commercial flock that's infected with high path avian influenza, we perform surveillance of all facilities in that immediate area, just target our surveillance there, to detect any potential additional cases. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:11:40]
> 
> So I'm knocking on wood as I say this, but that we've really been very lucky in the last several years to have dealt with relatively small outbreaks of disease. 
> 
> The last biggest outbreak where we really ramped up testing was actually during COVID, where our laboratory, like veterinary diagnostic labs across the country, ramped up high throughput testing to support COVID testing in people.
> 
> We were also testing animals, but because public health laboratories were so overwhelmed, we really stepped in and I think that's a-- I'm a veterinarian and a virologist by training, and I'm really passionate about the work that veterinary diagnostic labs do. And I think we did a really great job of stepping in and supporting. We're built for that. 
> 
> We are built for big herd level or population level outbreaks, more so I think than probably some public health laboratories might be, and that's not meant to be a criticism. It's just our job is to look at animal health, population health at that level. And so we really are just set up to be able to provide high throughput testing.
> 
> Also because we're looking at things from a population perspective, sometimes we can use population level sample types to be able to get a read of an entire population rather than having to test every single person like you would in sure in a human health outbreak, if that makes sense, or we can pool samples from multiple animals because we know if they're all part of the same flock or same herd, that one, if one is positive, the herd or flock is positive. And that's really the question that we're asking. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:14:11]
> 
> What we do in these sorts of circumstances is that we have people who are cross trained, sort of within the infectious disease areas in the laboratory. They might not normally work on viruses, but in the case of an outbreak like this, they're trained to perform that required testing for high path AI. 
> 
> So we're really leveraging all of our people who are especially trained and require special approvals from USDA to perform this testing. We're leveraging all of the people across the laboratory who have this training to perform the testing. 
> 
> We're still able to maintain all of our routine diagnostic testing, at this point.
> 
> And again, this is one of the beautiful things about working in the National Animal Health Laboratory Network is that while we're responsible for our state, we have the opportunity to leverage additional capacity at other states within our region or across the country if needed. 
> 
> And I say that because Michigan is-- we're a little bit at the heart of this outbreak right now, along with a couple of other states, because we have recent detections in our commercial layer and turkey facilities, we have the dairy cattle situation. And then we also have-- we are also providing all of the testing for wild birds in this region. I think we're covering six or eight states at this point. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:16:54]
> 
> I feel like I can give you a question today that's going to be different than it will be tomorrow, and different than it would've been yesterday. 
> 
> So I'd say that we are seeing in terms of identification of new herds, or testing potential infections of herds, that stayed pretty consistent since it was first detected in dairy cattle in Michigan. So we're evaluating, if there are animals displaying clinical signs. 
> 
> And I think it's important to note that in this case, the dairy cattle have a drop in milk production. They go off feed. Maybe they have a fever, but on the whole they recover. So they are not-- the severity of the disease is very different than it is in poultry. And in these dairy cattle, there are a lot of things that can cause drops in milk production. 
> 
> So we are doing a lot of testing to evaluate whether or not those clinical signs in our dairy cattle is associated with high path avian influenza or not. 
> 
> I would say that the we're in week two of the new federal order for interstate movement testing. And so I think it's really too early to stay just how much testing that's going to be. 
> 
> It's been pretty steady for the first seven days of the order. But we'll see how that evolves with time. 
> 
> And then the worried well, what we sometimes refer to as worried well testing, or I think we're still sort of understanding what other requirements are going to be, so some sale barns, for example, are requiring testing before animals come to the sale. 
> 
> So it's sort of based on different circumstances, testing may be required. So at this point, I'll be honest, I think it's just still-- as this situation evolves and we collectively as a country get our arms around just how widespread this is, I think it will inform what our testing requirements, testing approaches are going to be. 
> 
> But I can say that at this point in our laboratory, we are-- we have people who are working very hard, but we are comfortably able to meet all of the testing demands we have.
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:19:34]
> 
> I'm thinking about the pre movement testing we've done. I'm thinking about some of the other testing. 
> 
> The other bit of testing that we're doing, actually, that I didn't mention is we're working with researchers at MSU,  in the College of Veterinary Medicine, with our department of agriculture and USDA, as well as some farmers to be able to track affected herds and better understand how long these animals are shedding for. 
> 
> Are they shedding solely in the milk or are there other ways, because we really want to try to better understand how this virus is being transmitted within and across different herds, so we can better put into place response measures. 
> 
> So I can tell you we've performed hundreds of high path avian influenza tests in dairy cattle, but it's covers a very broad spectrum of testing purposes, if that makes sense.
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:21:06]
> 
> So for dairy cattle, the preferred sample type is milk. So as long as they're lactating, the recommended sample type is milk and that can be for pre movement testing or that can be if the animals are sick. 
> 
> And samples come to us and in plastic tubes that we are then able to pull samples from and we bring those tubes into the laboratory and utilize a small portion of that sample to be able to start that testing process, which requires a series of PCRs. I think we're all familiar with PCR post COVID. 
> 
> We do three rounds of it. The first one is to identify that the animal is infected with an influenza A virus. The second one confirms that it's H5. And the third one confirms it's the specific strain in question. So we're performing three tests on every sample.
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:22:33]
> 
> So what we're doing is that, if animals meet the case definition or how the clinical disease has been described in dairy cattle, the first thing we do is test for high path avian influenza. 
> 
> Once we rule that out, the samples will then get rolled into downstream testing, whether it's culturing for potential causes of mastitis, for example. So we track it, we follow it in that way. 
> 
> We work closely with our veterinarians to get a sense of the clinical science they're seeing so that we can develop a diagnostic strategy that makes the most sense, and most efficiently gets us to the right answer. It would be, in a perfect world, great to be able to test every single sample for every single possibility. 
> 
> But obviously we want to be efficient and, and cost effective in the work we do.
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:23:52]
> 
> We are doing and like, we do sort of refer to it informally as worried well to some degree, but we are-- we do want to perform that testing to get an understanding of how many asymptomatic animals there are out there.
> 
> The problem is that, again, that sample type is milk. It seems the virus seems to really like mammary glands. And so that's where we find the highest level of virus in an infected animal is in the milk itself. 
> 
> So if we have animals that aren't lactating or beef cattle, for example, we don't necessarily have a great sample type to be able to definitively say whether-- we don't have the same.

## EPI-WIN webinar by WHO regarding H5N1 detected in dairy cattle

> Todd Davis, CDC [00:40:01]
> 
> So the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still considers the risk to public health to be low. You know, this is a virus that after sequencing now more than several hundred viruses from cattle, we don't see any molecular changes that would indicate increased possibilities of infection or transmission from person to person. 
> 
> So we still consider this public health risk to be quite low. I think some of the exceptions may be those that have prolonged unprotected exposure to infected dairy cattle. So I think there are some likely risk associated with occupational exposure. 
> 
> ...
> 
> David Swayne, OFFLU [00:42:07] 
> 
> I'll just start off saying that, just to make sure we all are on the same page. You know, the first cases that were diagnosed were in dairy cattle in Texas. This particular virus has already mentioned by Maria is a specific genotype. So it is the 2.3.4.4b, but it has reassorted in North America with our low path avian influenza viruses. So what we see in dairy cattle is the B3.13 genotype, which makes it, when you look at the eight gene constellations, a virus that is not identical to what is circulating other parts of the world. 
> 
> So in the risk assessment that would need to be taken that information need to be taken to account, that the risk may be different in other parts of the world, because it's not the exact same eight gene reassortant that we had in dairy cattle.
> 
> ...
> 
> David Swayne, OFFLU [00:43:55] 
> 
> The mechanism of the transmission between cows is currently unknown, but based upon field observations, it would suggest that the transmission probably occurs in the unique environment of the dairy parlor, either through the mechanical transmission, through the milking process, or because there's continual cleaning going on in the dairy parlor, there are large droplets produced from that washing down process. 
> 
> So those are two leading theories or hypotheses, but they are not at this point proven hypotheses of how that transmission occurs.
> 
> ...
> 
> Todd Davis, CDC [00:45:13]
> 
> So in the United States, when a confirmed dairy farm has been detected and that detection is done by the U.S. Department of Agriculture at the state level, the veterinarians will report those confirmed dairy farms to state public health departments, and then the state public health departments will take actions to monitor individuals on those farms where there have been confirmed dairy cattle. 
> 
> And so that can be in the form of active monitoring where the names of workers are provided to local or state public health departments. And then those individuals could be monitored for up to 10 days post exposure. And then there's also quite a lot of passive monitoring of individuals as well, where state or local public health departments provide information and educational materials to those dairy farm workers, to those dairy farms, that do have confirmed outbreaks of H5N1, so that they have information that would allow them to do self-monitoring. 
> 
> And so, we understand there's quite a lot of self-monitoring for illness, and from the U.S. CDC's perspective in working with state and local public health departments, we know that there's been more than 220 individuals monitored and more than 30 persons that have been tested for influenza A with only one person having been detected as positive for H5N1, among those more than 220 individuals that have been monitored. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Todd Davis, CDC [00:47:06]
> 
> So there obviously is a lot of interest in understanding the potential for seroprevalence studies.
> 
> Currently, the influenza division is working with state and local public health departments to initiate serology studies in farm workers. So we hope to have more information on this very soon. So those studies are being initiated shortly. 
> 
> ...
> 
> David Swayne, OFFLU [00:48:04]
> 
> So, up to my knowledge, there has not been any data released, but there is ongoing investigations looking at serology, both in the herds that have been affected, as well as outside those affected dairy herds, and also looking at serology in beef cattle to see if there has been any exposure or infections there. 
> 
> So currently that, as to my understanding, is ongoing work. Not only the USDA is involved, but also individual universities and individual state departments of agriculture, as they try to get a handle on the epidemiology.
> 
> There's a fairly large workforce. I know that from USDA and many of their partners, with epidemiologists on the ground, trying to figure out these issues, and serology is one of the most important components that's being investigated.
> 
> ...
> 
> Richard Webby, WHO CC (St Jude Children's) [00:48:59]
> 
> There's some evidence that, you know, that at least cows that have, I guess cleared this disease, they do produce an antibody response that's detectable by sort of the standard assays. So as David said, I'm not-- there's lots of work going on in this space, but it does appear that, at least the assays are fit for purpose in this particular case, which is of course a good thing. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Richard Webby, WHO CC (St Jude Children's) [00:49:28]
> 
> No evidence that swine are involved in this particular instance at all. A number of people have done some experimental infection of pigs with some of these 2.3.4.4b H5 viruses with the results sort of ranging from very little replication to reasonable replication, but transmission not being highly robust. So, right now, pigs don't seem to be playing a role in the 2.3.4.4b. Certainly not in terms of spread at any level.
> 
> ...
> 
> David Swayne, OFFLU [00:50:11]
> 
> Right now there is the HI, is of course our gold standard test for looking for antibodies against the  hemagglutinin, but it is not a common test used outside of reference laboratories. 
> 
> But there has been several groups that are looking at validation. I think some of them have actually completed their validation studies of using the ELISA, various different ELISA tests, as a surrogate for the HI test, and those results look pretty good. So it will probably be that most of the serology will be done using ELISA tests, as opposed to HI that will be the conducted in cow.

- **Date:** received May 2, 2024

> There is currently no evidence to suggest the virus is present in muscle tissue of dairy cattle that have tested positive for HPAI. The pathology of the virus has shown that it has an affinity for the mammary tissue. The retail ground beef testing was exploratory in nature. For the ground beef retail testing, FSIS identified the states that had herds affected with HPAI. The sampling was intended to provide an immediate answer about the safety of ground beef. As mentioned, it is being done in conjunction with other beef safety studies. Together these studies are meant to produce data and expand our knowledge related to H5N1 in cattle and beef, particularly in the interest of scientific inquiry.

> The number of people who are being monitored at any one time tends to be very dynamic. So as you know, you've heard from Dr. Sifford, as herds resolved their illness, the monitoring period for people also goes away. 
> 
> So I think we-- I'll start by saying, our local partners have been working to monitor over a hundred people and, again, the testing number is dynamic, but again, it's over 20 people who have been tested. It's around 25, but again, that number is dynamic because, as they're monitoring, there's a very low threshold for individuals to get tested.

> I don't have in front of me how many folks had conjunctivitis, in terms of the folks who have been tested. I don't know the answer to that question at this time.

> We are aware, because there are so many different dairy products, there are probably a few more products that we would look at just so that we make sure that we've got a good national sample. And so any additional results we will make available as soon as they become, uh, available to us.

> We are very confident in the meat supply that it is safe. There's a lot of inspection process that we have right now that make sure that each animal gets inspected before slaughter and all cattle cartridges must pass inspection after slaughter, before they go into the food supply. 
> 
> So as far as the testing is concerned, we are doing three separate sampling efforts. The first one is we collected ground beef at retail from the affected states. The second is we are testing beef muscle samples from culled dairy cows also in the affected states. And then we have a third study which has to do with testing the effectiveness of cooking beef patties to make sure that the cooking kills the virus. 
> 
> So for the first one, which is the retail samples, the samples have been collected. They're currently at the lab NVSL, and we don't have the results yet. We will be sharing them with everybody as soon as they are available.
> 
> For the second study-- and if any of those samples become positive, we would actually have to do a calculations to see if what we find is live virus or not.
> 
> For this second study, the beef muscle from culled cows, we're collecting that for research purposes and to make sure that the virus is not spread throughout the entire animal. 
> 
> And for the third one, the cooking beef study, we're basically cooking beef patties at three different temperatures to document that cooking kills the virus. Again, I want to emphasize, we are pretty sure that the meat supply is safe. We're doing this just to enhance our scientific knowledge, to make sure that we have additional data points to make that statement.

> So just to be clear monitoring, what I'm referring to monitoring, really is about a sort of symptom monitoring, and this is very similar to what happens in the setting of a poultry outbreak. 
> 
> And so the state health department has various systems that they use to monitor the health of individuals who are exposed. It can range from individual conversations on the phone, texts, apps, platforms for folks to text in on their symptoms. 
> 
> So I think that generally the way that this goes is that, when a herd is detected, the state interacts with their agricultural colleagues, as well as the farms, and then reaches out to the farms to make sure that whichever monitoring is the most appropriate for the setting and system that the state uses is the one that they use to monitor the health of workers exposed on the farm.

> 
> For Dr Prater, have you been able to trace back how the H5N1 positives ended up in retail milk? I mean, is this coming from asymptomatic cows?
> 
> And for Dr. Sifford, given from what you're hearing from producers, do you think it's possible we're past the peak in places like Northwest Texas?
> 
> Don Prater, FDA [00:46:41]
> 
> So, FDA is working with our federal partners to analyze the initial data that we've collected through this survey of retail milk. 
> 
> We recognize that processors can receive milk from hundreds of different farms, which may cross state lines. We would defer to USDA  to speak about anything on the assessment of the current animal health epidemiologic situation. 
> 
> So we're continuing to look at this information and we'll be sharing any further analysis as we have it. Thank you.

> Rosemary Sifford, USDA [00:47:14]
> 
> Yep. And this is Rosemary Siford with USDA. We do-- all of the evidence from our epidemiologic work, as well as our genomic sequencing, indicates that there was a single spillover event in that Texas panhandle region. And so we-- that event has passed and we do not see any evidence of additional spillover events.
> 
> Our work, through the testing for movement, will give us a more clear picture of any herds that might be still affected, but asymptomatic at this point.

> I think that this would be an interagency discussion, but the general aspects that we always look for, not just for making a vaccine recommendation or in that space is changes in the genetic code, the genetic and antigenic properties of the viruses that are circulating, any changes that would impact our current countermeasures, so CVVs, candidate vaccine viruses, our antiviral medications, as well as our diagnostics, and also any changes in the virus that are circulating that would suggest better adaptation to mammals.

> The initial spillover event in that geographic region likely was not an individual herd, but a number of herds in that region. And then animals from those herds moving to other herds in other states were the initial movement of the virus. 
> 
> And then there has been subsequent movement from those subsequently affected herds. So not that-- not that there was a single herd, but a group of herds in that region that were where the original spillover event occurred.

> So we are continuing to analyze the results of the retail milk survey. So just a reminder that we identified some PCR positives, and we followed up with the, a inoculation test that did not detect any live viable virus. So that's an important point. 
> 
> We are analyzing the information that we acquired from tha survey. It's important to point out that milk purchased in a particular state doesn't mean that it was produced or processed in that state. In fact, milk could be from cows on a farm a few states away, processed, pasteurized in a different state, and available for purchasing in yet another state. 
> 
> So we are continuing to look at that analysis. We're sharing that with our federal partners. And we will have something more to say on that in the days to come.

> We are looking at that as part of our studies to validate the pasteurization parameters. So it's important that we have some indication of what viral load might actually be sent to a pasteurizer so that we can assess the effectiveness of the pasteurization criteria. 
> 
> So we are looking at that through a collaboration with our state partners.
