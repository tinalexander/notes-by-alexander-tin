> Robert Califf, FDA [00:30:01]
> 
> We've talked about one health for a long time. The fact that we all live in a world in a universe where animals and humans are more and more connected because of international transportation. The fact that more people are living closer to farms and on farms, but this is a real example of one health. 
> 
> Just roughly speaking. It's always a little more complicated than just the first take on it. But essentially the agriculture department regulates the cows. We regulate the milk at the FDA and the CDC has primary responsibility for the health of the workers, on the dairy farms. And so we all have to work together, across these organizations and agencies to take care of things. 
> 
> And, there's so many aspects I can't go through at all, but primarily from the FDA perspective today, we are accountable for the milk. So when we heard about the problem, we needed to launch a program of testing the milk to make sure that it was safe, knowing that it was likely that there were more infected herds than we initially knew. 
> 
> And in fact, that's what we found. As you well know when we looked at just milk before pasteurization, that is the raw milk coming into the into the bulk tanks, about 20% of a national sample turn out to have fragments of virus in it. And then the question was, is this infectious virus, or is it essentially, fragments of dead virus that had been taken care of by pasteurization? We had a good reason to believe pasteurization would work because of a hundred years of pasteurized milk. And in fact, it did, we found no evidence of live virus.
> 
> And I'm pleased to say, there are many NIH and agriculture department researchers around the country, universities who were also looking and we all found the same thing, but now, the other part that we're accountable for at HHS and within FDA is the countermeasures in case this does jump to humans. So we got to have testing, got to have antivirals, and we need to have a vaccine ready to go. 
> 
> So we've been busy getting prepared for, if the virus does mutate in a way that jumps into humans on a larger level.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:32:30]
> 
> Throughout all of this, because there's so many agencies involved, countless hours of phone calls and Zoom conferences to make sure that we're all coordinated all in an environment where, let's just say, it's not easy to get access to the farms because, you know, people are understandably protective of the environments in which they work. 
> 
> So, a lot of work across the agencies here, and I feel like it's been a good example of how one health can come together. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:39:38]
> 
> Unfortunately, there is no-- there's no absolute barrier that can be created, but there are elements of protection that are important, like farm workers, if they're on a farm with infected cattle, and one good thing here, the cattle don't die. The mortality rate of cows is with this virus is less than 1% from what we're told. So the cattle will recover.
> 
> But the workers need to be protected with PPE, just like, we all went through with hospital workers with COVID when you're around animals that are infected in the poultry industry, as you may know, they've already been through this. And the use of PPE is just routine in the poultry industry, but this is new for the cattle industry. 
> 
> And so there's a lot of work to be done to get to the right place there.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:45:10]
> 
> We do have some hurdles. And I'll just say, well, beyond that, you also know that the states play a huge role in the management of the safety of the food and farms in particular. 
> 
> And so we're constantly in touch with all the regulators in the states and every state system is different in terms of how it's configured. So access to the farms, for example, is something that really has to be negotiated through the states, the farmers, and the owners of dairy farms are more comfortable with people that they know that are in their states. 
> 
> So all this has to be coordinated. I feel like we're doing a good job of that.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:46:15]
> 
> The pasteurized milk is absolutely no problem to test because we just have-- we have people that go to stores and buy milk off the shelves anyway, for all sorts of other testing.
> 
> As, as I'm sure you know, from the state that you're in, you have all these cows, the milk goes into bulk tanks, which is a mixture of a number of cows. And that's a very sensitive area because it does point if they're infected cows as to where the infections are.
> 
> And technically it's no problem, but we want to make sure that we have trust. And so, there's negotiation that needs to go on to make sure that there's a safe way to handle the data and that people are not gonna be castigated if they happen to have an infected herd. 
> 
> So we're working through all that state by state.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:47:22]
> 
> As you might imagine, we've expended a lot of resources in the absence of any additional funding and we're keeping track of that and looking at potential sources within, in our case within HHS, for example.
> 
> I think it's predictable that we're gonna be in a new environment for milk in particular because of this virus, the way it's affected other species as it sort of cycles around. 
> 
> And, one thing about, um, cattle, they don't-- there are always new cattle coming up, so they're always gonna be naive cattle that are susceptible to getting infected. 
> 
> So it's predictable there'll be a need for resources.
> 
> We're keeping track of things. And as we get a handle on what we need to do going forward, we'll keep you completely informed about where we stand, including the reserve opportunities within HHS.

## WHO press briefing on global health issues on 8 May

> Wenqing Zhang, WHO [00:17:05]
> 
> We do have a system in place, if human to human transmission occurs, and if a pandemic starts, the system will be triggered to have to take a serious response. 
> 
> As Maria said, that there's ongoing risk assessment and there's an update of candidate vaccine viruses. 
> 
> So for the current H5N1 in cows, we have two, but it will also need to bear into mind, there are also other place of H5 virus circulating, and we also have candidates for these other clades of H5 viruses. And it's not only H5. They could also be H7, H10. 
> 
> So all these candidate viruses are being updated by the system and being distributed to vaccine developers. So once the situation warrants, they will be triggered into action to scale up the production.
> 
> Also to add that this system also producing reagents to enable the release of the vaccines to add that, for the seasonal influenza, there's influenza program in place. So the deployment system also in place in countries that could be used for the pandemic response.
> 
> As Maria said, that if we look at the seasonal vaccine production capacity, we will be able to, of course, on the assumption of the similar antigen dose, as well as the egg supply, for example, all smooth, we will be able to have more than 8 billion doses. That's the best scenario of estimate. 
> 
> And this is only taking into consideration of the existing platform, licensed platform, there are also other novel platforms under development, and there are also vaccines in trials.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mike Ryan, WHO [00:19:14]
> 
> That global network of laboratories who work all around the world, including our colleagues at CDC Atlanta, are extremely vigilant in the way they've shared information and specimens through the PIP framework and to have candidate vaccines in place and to have manufacturers in place ready to produce vaccine. 
> 
> And you may ask out there, well, why don't we just produce a vaccine now? Well, first of all, we got to make sure it works against this clade, which we believe it does. And again, I think our colleagues at CDC in Atlanta are testing human sera of people previously vaccinated with H5 vaccines to look for that cross reactivity and make sure that the candidate vaccines would work. 
> 
> And secondly, we produce hundreds of millions of seasonal flu vaccines every year, and we would have to switch production. So it's not-- you can't just press the button and begin producing pandemic H5 vaccines. You have to stop producing your seasonal vaccine and all of you out there know how lifesaving that vaccine is both in the Northern and Southern hemisphere. 
> 
> So this is not a-- this requires a very careful consideration, as Wenqing said, to determine whether this virus does switch.
> 
> ...
> 
> Wenqing Zhang, WHO [00:36:42]
> 
> When we are talking about risk assessment, we need to be very specific. Risk on what? Risk associated with what? 
> 
> So here we are talking about that virus at moment, circulating detected in cows in the U.S. The risk of this virus to become human to human transmissibility, transmissible in humans, this is a risk assessment we were talking about, and we assess that the risk is low.
> 
> But at moment, this is this form of the virus. And we know influenza virus is constantly changing. So if for this virus to become a pandemic virus, it will undergo a lot of changes so that it could transmit easily among human to human. 
> 
> You also asked about whether the next pandemic could be harmless, or basically whether it'll be mild or severe. So first, as I mentioned, for the pandemic influenza virus, we need really need to take one step back, not just to that particular clade at moment in the U.S., B3.13, we also need to bear into mind, there are also other clades is called 2.3.2.1c is also circulating and infecting humans in Southeast Asia. That's H5. 
> 
> In addition to H5, I already mentioned we had H7, we have H10. So these are avian viruses. Aside from avian viruses, we also have swine viruses is called a variant, which caused the 2009 pandemic. 
> 
> So the global system, we basically keep all these virus under monitoring and continuing doing the risk assessment, continuing update the candidate vaccine virus, so that when situation warrants, the response could be triggered immediately.
> 
> ...
> 
> Helen Branswell, STAT [00:39:21]
> 
> Do you have a word yet whether the suspected Ebola case in Burundi is actually Ebola and, any details about, I think there's a suspected second case. And while we're talking, can you tell me, where is vaccine and can it be deployed quickly to the region if it's needed? Thank you,
> 
> ...
> 
> Abdi Mahamud, WHO [00:39:48]
> 
> Thanks, Helen. We are aware of two suspected viral hemorrhagic fever cases from southern (unclear), Democratic Republic of Congo, that were referred to Burundi. 
> 
> The first case that passed away was a nine year old child, passed on second May. Samples was collected from there, and immediately the government have started the investigation and collecting samples, on second May. 
> 
> So far, we received a few challenges with their flight in transporting to samples and the team, the country of this ministry was able to send us samples to DRC in Goma to be tested. As we speak the lab is conducting the test, and hopefully the government will announce whether it's negative or not.
> 
> But as you know, we have to also send us samples to a WHO reference lab for the final confirmation. 
> 
> Because of the detection of the suspected virus, the government increased the surveillance and announced and improved surveillance led to detection of several cases. We had the second child suspected eight year old, in a stable condition. Initial samples also taken by that child as we speak right now is in a stable condition. 
> 
> Contact tracing have started, almost 20 contacts for the first case, 25 contacts. But more importantly is the situation in DRC. As you're aware, DRC has been responding to multiple outbreak of Ebola. They do have the response capacity and they've started the investigation, send a multidisciplinary team there and contacting where the child came from, around 75 contact has been traced and the team is out in the field. 
> 
> So in summary, there's close collaboration between the two countries, our team there in the field office, regional office are supporting the government. And once we have, we will share with you. 
> 
> And we'll really like to appreciate the ministry of health in Burundi, which came out with all the information in a transparent way and all the teams that have been supporting this investigation. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:47:02]
> 
> On SARS-CoV-2, can you tell us more about KP.2 and vaccines, is anything being done to look at KP.2's mutations against antibodies or in vivo? 
> 
> And then on H5N1, can you expand a little bit on that kind of production ultimatum you were talking about earlier? You know, why is it not possible simply just to fold that CVV into a new seasonal quadrivalent? Thanks so much.
> 
> ...
> 
> Wenqing Zhang, WHO [00:47:45]
> 
> Yes. So with regards, why we cannot just click the button and put the virus, change the virus itself. So there are couple reasons here. 
> 
> First is that, as probably you know, that at moment, all the vaccine productions are ongoing to produce seasonal vaccines. And, there should be a situation that warrants that is there a need to stop the seasonal of vaccine production, switch to the pandemic vaccine production, and also in the vaccine production, the plants they would need to clean out, then would need to take certain procedures in order to start replacing with the pandemic CVVs itself. 
> 
> So this is a reason there's a process in place and also associated with that is a risk assessment, whether this situation really warrants a stop of seasonal vaccine production and switch to the pandemic, just to end up with every year seasonal influenza also kills more than 620,000 at least every year.
> 
> ...
> 
> Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO [00:49:01]
> 
> So the first part of the question asking about KP.2, so KP.2 is a descendant lineage of JN.1. JN.1 is dominant worldwide. Based on all of the sequences that are shared with online platforms like GISAID.
> 
> These are analyzed by our technical advisory group for virus evolution. So KP.2 has its descendant of JN.1 and has additional mutations in the spike protein. I won't read them out. And there are other emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. 
> 
> I just want to point out that JN.1 and these continues to evolve. So we're going to keep seeing these other variants in circulation.
> 
> Based on the information that we have, and the sequences that have been shared, there's about 8% of the sequences globally that are this variant, this KP.2, and the prevalence varies by region for lots of different reasons, based on the other waves of infection that have happened, the other variants that have circulated, and the amount of circulation of this virus. 
> 
> The first sequences that were reported were in January this year. So it's been circulating for some time, and we expect these percentages to change. 
> 
> Just wanted to highlight that our technical advisory group for COVID 19 vaccine composition recommended that future formulations of vaccine do include JN.1, but also we state that countries should be using all available, safe and effective COVID 19 vaccines, according to SAGE recommendations, primarily focusing on people who are most at risk for developing severe disease. 
> 
> So it's one that we are watching. It's one that we are monitoring. And again, reiterate the need for continued surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in people, around the world, so that we can monitor this evolution of this virus. The virus is circulating in all countries. It continues to evolve. And for us to do risk assessments on SARS-CoV-2 remains critically important.

## FDA spokesperson on postponing VRBPAC meeting

- **Date:** received May 8, 2024

> As announced, the May 16, 2024, meeting of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) is being rescheduled to June 5, 2024. The FDA, along with its public health partners, carefully monitors trends in the circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. As has happened since the emergence of COVID-19, we have recently observed shifts in the dominant circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. 
> 
> The additional time will allow the agency to obtain more up-to-date surveillance data and other information on the circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 to better inform the committee’s discussions and recommendations of which strain(s) to include in the 2024-2025 Formula for the approved and authorized COVID-19 vaccines intended for the U.S. market.

## HHS spokesperson on DACA recipients in Mediciad

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** on background, from a Health and Human Services spokesperson
- **Date:** received May 7, 2024

> DACA recipients who would have been included in any change to Medicaid, will be covered under the Marketplace. As noted in the Fact Sheet released on May 3: “We expect that individuals who would have been eligible for Medicaid or CHIP under these proposals, including DACA recipients, will be eligible for Health Insurance Marketplace coverage with financial assistance or BHP coverage if they meet other eligibility requirements. The ACA allows noncitizens who are ineligible for Medicaid due to their immigration status to access financial assistance, such as Premium Tax Credits (PTC) and Cost Sharing Reductions (CSRs) through a Marketplace plan even if their income is below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL).” 
> 
> In addition, as noted in the final rule, CMS received a large volume of comments, many in favor, and some opposed to a definition of “lawfully present” that includes DACA recipients. CMS is not finalizing a “lawfully  present” definition for Medicaid and CHIP at this time. Rather, CMS is taking more time to evaluate and carefully consider the comments regarding the proposal with respect to Medicaid and CHIP.
> 
> (See discussion, beginning on pg. 5 of this final rule: public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-09661.pdf)
> 
> Currently, CMS does not have a timeline to finalize changes to DACA eligibility in Medicaid and CHIP.

## Michigan State University laboratory on H5N1 testing in dairy cattle

- **Source:** phone interview
- **Attribution:** Kimberly Dodd, director of Michigan State University's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory
- **Date:** occurred May 7, 2024

> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:06:58]
> 
> So we're a pretty big laboratory. We have about 150 faculty and staff, and we run a million tests a year. Now the vast majority of that is routine testing. 
> 
> So again, we're an animal health laboratory. We support the MSU Veterinary Medical Center, which is the teaching hospital for the College of Veterinary Medicine. But we also support veterinarians and veterinary clinics across the state, actually around the country, and in 25 countries. So we do a lot of routine diagnostic testing. 
> 
> One of our areas of specialty is endocrinology. You might be aware that dogs and cats often have thyroid disease, for example. And so that all sits in our wheelhouse. 
> 
> So that's the vast majority of what we do on a daily basis, but at the same time, we are part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network or the NAHLN. That's a network of 63 academic state and federal laboratories that serves as the first line of defense in the case of incursion of a high consequence animal disease like high path AI. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:09:03]
> 
> So as members of the NAHLN, we are constantly preparing for potential disease outbreaks. We do tabletop and functional exercises in our state, in our region, and nationwide exercises as well. Our goal is always to understand what is the potential needs for diagnostic testing, going to be in the case of widespread outbreak and how do we ensure that we're prepared to ramp up that testing? 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:09:54]
> 
> So we're constantly looking to be able to rapidly detect an emergence of, again, a high consequence disease threat.
> 
> When that does happen, and we detect it, that's when we move into sort of outbreak response, which for us is surge capacity. It means ramping up high throughput testing to be able to provide rapid diagnostic test results to veterinarians, state and federal officials, industry as quickly as possible. 
> 
> That outbreak testing includes not only identifying additional facilities or premises that might be infected, but also being able to do active surveillance. So for example, when we know we have a commercial flock that's infected with high path avian influenza, we perform surveillance of all facilities in that immediate area, just target our surveillance there, to detect any potential additional cases. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:11:40]
> 
> So I'm knocking on wood as I say this, but that we've really been very lucky in the last several years to have dealt with relatively small outbreaks of disease. 
> 
> The last biggest outbreak where we really ramped up testing was actually during COVID, where our laboratory, like veterinary diagnostic labs across the country, ramped up high throughput testing to support COVID testing in people.
> 
> We were also testing animals, but because public health laboratories were so overwhelmed, we really stepped in and I think that's a-- I'm a veterinarian and a virologist by training, and I'm really passionate about the work that veterinary diagnostic labs do. And I think we did a really great job of stepping in and supporting. We're built for that. 
> 
> We are built for big herd level or population level outbreaks, more so I think than probably some public health laboratories might be, and that's not meant to be a criticism. It's just our job is to look at animal health, population health at that level. And so we really are just set up to be able to provide high throughput testing.
> 
> Also because we're looking at things from a population perspective, sometimes we can use population level sample types to be able to get a read of an entire population rather than having to test every single person like you would in sure in a human health outbreak, if that makes sense, or we can pool samples from multiple animals because we know if they're all part of the same flock or same herd, that one, if one is positive, the herd or flock is positive. And that's really the question that we're asking. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:14:11]
> 
> What we do in these sorts of circumstances is that we have people who are cross trained, sort of within the infectious disease areas in the laboratory. They might not normally work on viruses, but in the case of an outbreak like this, they're trained to perform that required testing for high path AI. 
> 
> So we're really leveraging all of our people who are especially trained and require special approvals from USDA to perform this testing. We're leveraging all of the people across the laboratory who have this training to perform the testing. 
> 
> We're still able to maintain all of our routine diagnostic testing, at this point.
> 
> And again, this is one of the beautiful things about working in the National Animal Health Laboratory Network is that while we're responsible for our state, we have the opportunity to leverage additional capacity at other states within our region or across the country if needed. 
> 
> And I say that because Michigan is-- we're a little bit at the heart of this outbreak right now, along with a couple of other states, because we have recent detections in our commercial layer and turkey facilities, we have the dairy cattle situation. And then we also have-- we are also providing all of the testing for wild birds in this region. I think we're covering six or eight states at this point. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:16:54]
> 
> I feel like I can give you a question today that's going to be different than it will be tomorrow, and different than it would've been yesterday. 
> 
> So I'd say that we are seeing in terms of identification of new herds, or testing potential infections of herds, that stayed pretty consistent since it was first detected in dairy cattle in Michigan. So we're evaluating, if there are animals displaying clinical signs. 
> 
> And I think it's important to note that in this case, the dairy cattle have a drop in milk production. They go off feed. Maybe they have a fever, but on the whole they recover. So they are not-- the severity of the disease is very different than it is in poultry. And in these dairy cattle, there are a lot of things that can cause drops in milk production. 
> 
> So we are doing a lot of testing to evaluate whether or not those clinical signs in our dairy cattle is associated with high path avian influenza or not. 
> 
> I would say that the we're in week two of the new federal order for interstate movement testing. And so I think it's really too early to stay just how much testing that's going to be. 
> 
> It's been pretty steady for the first seven days of the order. But we'll see how that evolves with time. 
> 
> And then the worried well, what we sometimes refer to as worried well testing, or I think we're still sort of understanding what other requirements are going to be, so some sale barns, for example, are requiring testing before animals come to the sale. 
> 
> So it's sort of based on different circumstances, testing may be required. So at this point, I'll be honest, I think it's just still-- as this situation evolves and we collectively as a country get our arms around just how widespread this is, I think it will inform what our testing requirements, testing approaches are going to be. 
> 
> But I can say that at this point in our laboratory, we are-- we have people who are working very hard, but we are comfortably able to meet all of the testing demands we have.
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:19:34]
> 
> I'm thinking about the pre movement testing we've done. I'm thinking about some of the other testing. 
> 
> The other bit of testing that we're doing, actually, that I didn't mention is we're working with researchers at MSU,  in the College of Veterinary Medicine, with our department of agriculture and USDA, as well as some farmers to be able to track affected herds and better understand how long these animals are shedding for. 
> 
> Are they shedding solely in the milk or are there other ways, because we really want to try to better understand how this virus is being transmitted within and across different herds, so we can better put into place response measures. 
> 
> So I can tell you we've performed hundreds of high path avian influenza tests in dairy cattle, but it's covers a very broad spectrum of testing purposes, if that makes sense.
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:21:06]
> 
> So for dairy cattle, the preferred sample type is milk. So as long as they're lactating, the recommended sample type is milk and that can be for pre movement testing or that can be if the animals are sick. 
> 
> And samples come to us and in plastic tubes that we are then able to pull samples from and we bring those tubes into the laboratory and utilize a small portion of that sample to be able to start that testing process, which requires a series of PCRs. I think we're all familiar with PCR post COVID. 
> 
> We do three rounds of it. The first one is to identify that the animal is infected with an influenza A virus. The second one confirms that it's H5. And the third one confirms it's the specific strain in question. So we're performing three tests on every sample.
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:22:33]
> 
> So what we're doing is that, if animals meet the case definition or how the clinical disease has been described in dairy cattle, the first thing we do is test for high path avian influenza. 
> 
> Once we rule that out, the samples will then get rolled into downstream testing, whether it's culturing for potential causes of mastitis, for example. So we track it, we follow it in that way. 
> 
> We work closely with our veterinarians to get a sense of the clinical science they're seeing so that we can develop a diagnostic strategy that makes the most sense, and most efficiently gets us to the right answer. It would be, in a perfect world, great to be able to test every single sample for every single possibility. 
> 
> But obviously we want to be efficient and, and cost effective in the work we do.
> 
> ...
> 
> Kimberly Dodd, MSU VDL [00:23:52]
> 
> We are doing and like, we do sort of refer to it informally as worried well to some degree, but we are-- we do want to perform that testing to get an understanding of how many asymptomatic animals there are out there.
> 
> The problem is that, again, that sample type is milk. It seems the virus seems to really like mammary glands. And so that's where we find the highest level of virus in an infected animal is in the milk itself. 
> 
> So if we have animals that aren't lactating or beef cattle, for example, we don't necessarily have a great sample type to be able to definitively say whether-- we don't have the same.

> _Do you have any figures on how many heads have been tested, or how many tests have been conducted so far?_
> 
> We have conducted approximately 600 influenza A tests on samples from cattle.
> 
> _What is the best way to describe the pace of samples needing to be tested? Is it increasing?_
> 
> Sample submissions have slowed since the Federal Order but we expect them to increase slightly and remain fairly consistent.
> 
> _What share of your tests are from suspect cases versus interstate travel requests?_
> 
> As one of the first states to have influenza A detected in cattle samples, most of our samples have been from suspect herds. Moving forward, we expect that most submissions will be a result of interstate movement.

> Todd Davis, CDC [00:40:01]
> 
> So the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still considers the risk to public health to be low. You know, this is a virus that after sequencing now more than several hundred viruses from cattle, we don't see any molecular changes that would indicate increased possibilities of infection or transmission from person to person. 
> 
> So we still consider this public health risk to be quite low. I think some of the exceptions may be those that have prolonged unprotected exposure to infected dairy cattle. So I think there are some likely risk associated with occupational exposure. 
> 
> ...
> 
> David Swayne, OFFLU [00:42:07] 
> 
> I'll just start off saying that, just to make sure we all are on the same page. You know, the first cases that were diagnosed were in dairy cattle in Texas. This particular virus has already mentioned by Maria is a specific genotype. So it is the 2.3.4.4b, but it has reassorted in North America with our low path avian influenza viruses. So what we see in dairy cattle is the B3.13 genotype, which makes it, when you look at the eight gene constellations, a virus that is not identical to what is circulating other parts of the world. 
> 
> So in the risk assessment that would need to be taken that information need to be taken to account, that the risk may be different in other parts of the world, because it's not the exact same eight gene reassortant that we had in dairy cattle.
> 
> ...
> 
> David Swayne, OFFLU [00:43:55] 
> 
> The mechanism of the transmission between cows is currently unknown, but based upon field observations, it would suggest that the transmission probably occurs in the unique environment of the dairy parlor, either through the mechanical transmission, through the milking process, or because there's continual cleaning going on in the dairy parlor, there are large droplets produced from that washing down process. 
> 
> So those are two leading theories or hypotheses, but they are not at this point proven hypotheses of how that transmission occurs.
> 
> ...
> 
> Todd Davis, CDC [00:45:13]
> 
> So in the United States, when a confirmed dairy farm has been detected and that detection is done by the U.S. Department of Agriculture at the state level, the veterinarians will report those confirmed dairy farms to state public health departments, and then the state public health departments will take actions to monitor individuals on those farms where there have been confirmed dairy cattle. 
> 
> And so that can be in the form of active monitoring where the names of workers are provided to local or state public health departments. And then those individuals could be monitored for up to 10 days post exposure. And then there's also quite a lot of passive monitoring of individuals as well, where state or local public health departments provide information and educational materials to those dairy farm workers, to those dairy farms, that do have confirmed outbreaks of H5N1, so that they have information that would allow them to do self-monitoring. 
> 
> And so, we understand there's quite a lot of self-monitoring for illness, and from the U.S. CDC's perspective in working with state and local public health departments, we know that there's been more than 220 individuals monitored and more than 30 persons that have been tested for influenza A with only one person having been detected as positive for H5N1, among those more than 220 individuals that have been monitored. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Todd Davis, CDC [00:47:06]
> 
> So there obviously is a lot of interest in understanding the potential for seroprevalence studies.
> 
> Currently, the influenza division is working with state and local public health departments to initiate serology studies in farm workers. So we hope to have more information on this very soon. So those studies are being initiated shortly. 
> 
> ...
> 
> David Swayne, OFFLU [00:48:04]
> 
> So, up to my knowledge, there has not been any data released, but there is ongoing investigations looking at serology, both in the herds that have been affected, as well as outside those affected dairy herds, and also looking at serology in beef cattle to see if there has been any exposure or infections there. 
> 
> So currently that, as to my understanding, is ongoing work. Not only the USDA is involved, but also individual universities and individual state departments of agriculture, as they try to get a handle on the epidemiology.
> 
> There's a fairly large workforce. I know that from USDA and many of their partners, with epidemiologists on the ground, trying to figure out these issues, and serology is one of the most important components that's being investigated.
> 
> ...
> 
> Richard Webby, WHO CC (St Jude Children's) [00:48:59]
> 
> There's some evidence that, you know, that at least cows that have, I guess cleared this disease, they do produce an antibody response that's detectable by sort of the standard assays. So as David said, I'm not-- there's lots of work going on in this space, but it does appear that, at least the assays are fit for purpose in this particular case, which is of course a good thing. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Richard Webby, WHO CC (St Jude Children's) [00:49:28]
> 
> No evidence that swine are involved in this particular instance at all. A number of people have done some experimental infection of pigs with some of these 2.3.4.4b H5 viruses with the results sort of ranging from very little replication to reasonable replication, but transmission not being highly robust. So, right now, pigs don't seem to be playing a role in the 2.3.4.4b. Certainly not in terms of spread at any level.
> 
> ...
> 
> David Swayne, OFFLU [00:50:11]
> 
> Right now there is the HI, is of course our gold standard test for looking for antibodies against the  hemagglutinin, but it is not a common test used outside of reference laboratories. 
> 
> But there has been several groups that are looking at validation. I think some of them have actually completed their validation studies of using the ELISA, various different ELISA tests, as a surrogate for the HI test, and those results look pretty good. So it will probably be that most of the serology will be done using ELISA tests, as opposed to HI that will be the conducted in cow.

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** on background from a U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesperson
- **Date:** received May 2, 2024

> There is currently no evidence to suggest the virus is present in muscle tissue of dairy cattle that have tested positive for HPAI. The pathology of the virus has shown that it has an affinity for the mammary tissue. The retail ground beef testing was exploratory in nature. For the ground beef retail testing, FSIS identified the states that had herds affected with HPAI. The sampling was intended to provide an immediate answer about the safety of ground beef. As mentioned, it is being done in conjunction with other beef safety studies. Together these studies are meant to produce data and expand our knowledge related to H5N1 in cattle and beef, particularly in the interest of scientific inquiry.

> Some of the patterns that we've talked about before continue to hold true. It appears that there is a single spillover event in the Texas panhandle geographic region from wild birds into dairy cattle. The wild birds are believed to be the initial source of the infection in dairy cattle, and then cattle movements spread the virus into other dairy cattle herds, and then subsequently into poultry flocks.
> 
> Affected herds are still seeing approximately 10% of the herd that display symptoms, and those cattle that display symptoms generally return to near their previous production levels, after they recover from the virus, which is taking around two weeks. We also continue to see that most cows do recover with palliative treatment with little or no associated mortality.

> 
> The number of people who are being monitored at any one time tends to be very dynamic. So as you know, you've heard from Dr. Sifford, as herds resolved their illness, the monitoring period for people also goes away. 
> 
> So I think we-- I'll start by saying, our local partners have been working to monitor over a hundred people and, again, the testing number is dynamic, but again, it's over 20 people who have been tested. It's around 25, but again, that number is dynamic because, as they're monitoring, there's a very low threshold for individuals to get tested.

> 
> We are aware, because there are so many different dairy products, there are probably a few more products that we would look at just so that we make sure that we've got a good national sample. And so any additional results we will make available as soon as they become, uh, available to us.
> 
> ...
> 
> Emilio Esteban, FSIS [00:40:30]
> 
> We are very confident in the meat supply that it is safe. There's a lot of inspection process that we have right now that make sure that each animal gets inspected before slaughter and all cattle cartridges must pass inspection after slaughter, before they go into the food supply. 
> 
> So as far as the testing is concerned, we are doing three separate sampling efforts. The first one is we collected ground beef at retail from the affected states. The second is we are testing beef muscle samples from culled dairy cows also in the affected states. And then we have a third study which has to do with testing the effectiveness of cooking beef patties to make sure that the cooking kills the virus. 
> 
> So for the first one, which is the retail samples, the samples have been collected. They're currently at the lab NVSL, and we don't have the results yet. We will be sharing them with everybody as soon as they are available.
> 
> For the second study-- and if any of those samples become positive, we would actually have to do a calculations to see if what we find is live virus or not.
> 
> For this second study, the beef muscle from culled cows, we're collecting that for research purposes and to make sure that the virus is not spread throughout the entire animal. 
> 
> And for the third one, the cooking beef study, we're basically cooking beef patties at three different temperatures to document that cooking kills the virus. Again, I want to emphasize, we are pretty sure that the meat supply is safe. We're doing this just to enhance our scientific knowledge, to make sure that we have additional data points to make that statement. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [00:43:11]
> 
> So just to be clear monitoring, what I'm referring to monitoring, really is about a sort of symptom monitoring, and this is very similar to what happens in the setting of a poultry outbreak. 
> 
> And so the state health department has various systems that they use to monitor the health of individuals who are exposed. It can range from individual conversations on the phone, texts, apps, platforms for folks to text in on their symptoms. 
> 
> So I think that generally the way that this goes is that, when a herd is detected, the state interacts with their agricultural colleagues, as well as the farms, and then reaches out to the farms to make sure that whichever monitoring is the most appropriate for the setting and system that the state uses is the one that they use to monitor the health of workers exposed on the farm.

> 
> Don Prater, FDA [00:46:41]
> 
> So, FDA is working with our federal partners to analyze the initial data that we've collected through this survey of retail milk.

> 
> Rosemary Sifford, USDA [00:47:14]
> 
> Yep. And this is Rosemary Siford with USDA. We do-- all of the evidence from our epidemiologic work, as well as our genomic sequencing, indicates that there was a single spillover event in that Texas panhandle region. And so we-- that event has passed and we do not see any evidence of additional spillover events.

> 
> Vivien Dugan, CDC [00:49:03] 
> 
> I think that this would be an interagency discussion, but the general aspects that we always look for, not just for making a vaccine recommendation or in that space is changes in the genetic code, the genetic and antigenic properties of the viruses that are circulating, any changes that would impact our current countermeasures, so CVVs, candidate vaccine viruses, our antiviral medications, as well as our diagnostics, and also any changes in the virus that are circulating that would suggest better adaptation to mammals. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Rosemary Sifford, USDA [00:50:52]
> 
> The initial spillover event in that geographic region likely was not an individual herd, but a number of herds in that region. And then animals from those herds moving to other herds in other states were the initial movement of the virus. 
> 
> And then there has been subsequent movement from those subsequently affected herds. So not that-- not that there was a single herd, but a group of herds in that region that were where the original spillover event occurred.
> 
> ...
> 
> Don Prater, FDA [00:52:54]
> 
> So we are continuing to analyze the results of the retail milk survey. So just a reminder that we identified some PCR positives, and we followed up with the, a inoculation test that did not detect any live viable virus. So that's an important point. 
> 
> We are analyzing the information that we acquired from tha survey. It's important to point out that milk purchased in a particular state doesn't mean that it was produced or processed in that state. In fact, milk could be from cows on a farm a few states away, processed, pasteurized in a different state, and available for purchasing in yet another state. 
> 
> So we are continuing to look at that analysis. We're sharing that with our federal partners. And we will have something more to say on that in the days to come.
> 
> ...
> 
> Don Prater, FDA [01:02:42]
> 
> We are looking at that as part of our studies to validate the pasteurization parameters. So it's important that we have some indication of what viral load might actually be sent to a pasteurizer so that we can assess the effectiveness of the pasteurization criteria.
