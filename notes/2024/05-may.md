> _Do you have any figures on how many heads have been tested, or how many tests have been conducted so far?_
> 
> As of May 2, 2024, the Ohio Department of Agricultureâ€™s (ODA) Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (ADDL) has tested 57 samples from cattle. This excludes the confirmed premises in Wood County.
> 
> _What is the best way to describe the pace of samples needing to be tested? Is it increasing?_
> 
> Yes. It is increasing due to the USDA-APHIS Federal Order requiring testing for interstate movement of lactating dairy cattle.
> 
> _What share of your tests are from suspect cases versus interstate travel requests?_
> 
> All samples tested as of May 2, 2024, have been for animal movement. This excludes the confirmed premises in Wood County.

## EPI-WIN webinar by WHO regarding H5N1 detected in dairy cattle

- **Attribution:** broadcasted by the World Health Organization
- **Date:** occurred May 6, 2024

> Todd Davis, CDC [00:40:01]
> 
> So the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still considers the risk to public health to be low. You know, this is a virus that after sequencing now more than several hundred viruses from cattle, we don't see any molecular changes that would indicate increased possibilities of infection or transmission from person to person. 
> 
> So we still consider this public health risk to be quite low. I think some of the exceptions may be those that have prolonged unprotected exposure to infected dairy cattle. So I think there are some likely risk associated with occupational exposure. 
> 
> ...
> 
> David Swayne, OFFLU [00:42:07] 
> 
> I'll just start off saying that, just to make sure we all are on the same page. You know, the first cases that were diagnosed were in dairy cattle in Texas. This particular virus has already mentioned by Maria is a specific genotype. So it is the 2.3.4.4b, but it has reassorted in North America with our low path avian influenza viruses. So what we see in dairy cattle is the B3.13 genotype, which makes it, when you look at the eight gene constellations, a virus that is not identical to what is circulating other parts of the world. 
> 
> So in the risk assessment that would need to be taken that information need to be taken to account, that the risk may be different in other parts of the world, because it's not the exact same eight gene reassortant that we had in dairy cattle.
> 
> ...
> 
> David Swayne, OFFLU [00:43:55] 
> 
> The mechanism of the transmission between cows is currently unknown, but based upon field observations, it would suggest that the transmission probably occurs in the unique environment of the dairy parlor, either through the mechanical transmission, through the milking process, or because there's continual cleaning going on in the dairy parlor, there are large droplets produced from that washing down process. 
> 
> So those are two leading theories or hypotheses, but they are not at this point proven hypotheses of how that transmission occurs.
> 
> ...
> 
> Todd Davis, CDC [00:45:13]
> 
> So in the United States, when a confirmed dairy farm has been detected and that detection is done by the U.S. Department of Agriculture at the state level, the veterinarians will report those confirmed dairy farms to state public health departments, and then the state public health departments will take actions to monitor individuals on those farms where there have been confirmed dairy cattle. 
> 
> And so that can be in the form of active monitoring where the names of workers are provided to local or state public health departments. And then those individuals could be monitored for up to 10 days post exposure. And then there's also quite a lot of passive monitoring of individuals as well, where state or local public health departments provide information and educational materials to those dairy farm workers, to those dairy farms, that do have confirmed outbreaks of H5N1, so that they have information that would allow them to do self-monitoring. 
> 
> And so, we understand there's quite a lot of self-monitoring for illness, and from the U.S. CDC's perspective in working with state and local public health departments, we know that there's been more than 220 individuals monitored and more than 30 persons that have been tested for influenza A with only one person having been detected as positive for H5N1, among those more than 220 individuals that have been monitored. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Todd Davis, CDC [00:47:06]
> 
> So there obviously is a lot of interest in understanding the potential for seroprevalence studies.
> 
> Currently, the influenza division is working with state and local public health departments to initiate serology studies in farm workers. So we hope to have more information on this very soon. So those studies are being initiated shortly. 
> 
> ...
> 
> David Swayne, OFFLU [00:48:04]
> 
> So, up to my knowledge, there has not been any data released, but there is ongoing investigations looking at serology, both in the herds that have been affected, as well as outside those affected dairy herds, and also looking at serology in beef cattle to see if there has been any exposure or infections there. 
> 
> So currently that, as to my understanding, is ongoing work. Not only the USDA is involved, but also individual universities and individual state departments of agriculture, as they try to get a handle on the epidemiology.
> 
> There's a fairly large workforce. I know that from USDA and many of their partners, with epidemiologists on the ground, trying to figure out these issues, and serology is one of the most important components that's being investigated.
> 
> ...
> 
> Richard Webby, WHO CC (St Jude Children's) [00:48:59]
> 
> There's some evidence that, you know, that at least cows that have, I guess cleared this disease, they do produce an antibody response that's detectable by sort of the standard assays. So as David said, I'm not-- there's lots of work going on in this space, but it does appear that, at least the assays are fit for purpose in this particular case, which is of course a good thing. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Richard Webby, WHO CC (St Jude Children's) [00:49:28]
> 
> No evidence that swine are involved in this particular instance at all. A number of people have done some experimental infection of pigs with some of these 2.3.4.4b H5 viruses with the results sort of ranging from very little replication to reasonable replication, but transmission not being highly robust. So, right now, pigs don't seem to be playing a role in the 2.3.4.4b. Certainly not in terms of spread at any level.
> 
> ...
> 
> David Swayne, OFFLU [00:50:11]
> 
> Right now there is the HI, is of course our gold standard test for looking for antibodies against the  hemagglutinin, but it is not a common test used outside of reference laboratories. 
> 
> But there has been several groups that are looking at validation. I think some of them have actually completed their validation studies of using the ELISA, various different ELISA tests, as a surrogate for the HI test, and those results look pretty good. So it will probably be that most of the serology will be done using ELISA tests, as opposed to HI that will be the conducted in cow.

## USDA spokesperson on sampling of ground beef for H5N1

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** on background from a U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesperson
- **Date:** received May 2, 2024

> There is currently no evidence to suggest the virus is present in muscle tissue of dairy cattle that have tested positive for HPAI. The pathology of the virus has shown that it has an affinity for the mammary tissue. The retail ground beef testing was exploratory in nature. For the ground beef retail testing, FSIS identified the states that had herds affected with HPAI. The sampling was intended to provide an immediate answer about the safety of ground beef. As mentioned, it is being done in conjunction with other beef safety studies. Together these studies are meant to produce data and expand our knowledge related to H5N1 in cattle and beef, particularly in the interest of scientific inquiry.

> 
> ...
> 
> From: Reed, Jasmine (CDC/IOD/OC)

- **Date:** received May 1, 2024

> The short answer is yes, it would eventually be able to be traced back to the affected herd. 
> 
> This would take extensive testing to trace it that far. We would be able to trace a particular gallon of milk back to what is called a "bulk tank", which is a tank of milk that is delivered to the bottling source. These bulk tanks include milk from multiple dairies, so we would have to test cows from all of the dairies whose milk was in the bulk tank.

> Don Prater, FDA [00:16:30]
> 
> These additional preliminary results further affirm the safety of the U.S. commercial milk supply. 
> 
> The FDA is continuing to identify additional products that we may test. We're also continuing to test samples of pooled, raw milk that has been routed to pasteurization and processing for commercial use. This will be used as a basis to characterize potential virus levels that pasteurization may encounter and will be used to inform our studies to further validate pasteurization. 
> 
> These important efforts are ongoing and we're committed to sharing additional testing results as soon as possible. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Rosemary Sifford, USDA [00:26:01]
> 
> Some of the patterns that we've talked about before continue to hold true. It appears that there is a single spillover event in the Texas panhandle geographic region from wild birds into dairy cattle. The wild birds are believed to be the initial source of the infection in dairy cattle, and then cattle movements spread the virus into other dairy cattle herds, and then subsequently into poultry flocks.
> 
> Affected herds are still seeing approximately 10% of the herd that display symptoms, and those cattle that display symptoms generally return to near their previous production levels, after they recover from the virus, which is taking around two weeks. We also continue to see that most cows do recover with palliative treatment with little or no associated mortality. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Rosemary Sifford, USDA [00:33:25]
> 
> Our focus is on identifying the currently affected herds and being able to work with them to eradicate the virus from the herd. But we do have plans to do some serologic testing to try to understand the overall scope including previously infected herds.
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [00:34:58]
> 
> The number of people who are being monitored at any one time tends to be very dynamic. So as you know, you've heard from Dr. Sifford, as herds resolved their illness, the monitoring period for people also goes away. 
> 
> So I think we-- I'll start by saying, our local partners have been working to monitor over a hundred people and, again, the testing number is dynamic, but again, it's over 20 people who have been tested. It's around 25, but again, that number is dynamic because, as they're monitoring, there's a very low threshold for individuals to get tested. 
> 
> I don't have in front of me how many folks had conjunctivitis, in terms of the folks who have been tested. I don't know the answer to that question at this time.
> 
> ...
> 
> Don Prater, FDA [00:37:27]
> 
> We are aware, because there are so many different dairy products, there are probably a few more products that we would look at just so that we make sure that we've got a good national sample. And so any additional results we will make available as soon as they become, uh, available to us.
> 
> ...
> 
> Emilio Esteban, FSIS [00:40:30]
> 
> We are very confident in the meat supply that it is safe. There's a lot of inspection process that we have right now that make sure that each animal gets inspected before slaughter and all cattle cartridges must pass inspection after slaughter, before they go into the food supply. 
> 
> So as far as the testing is concerned, we are doing three separate sampling efforts. The first one is we collected ground beef at retail from the affected states. The second is we are testing beef muscle samples from culled dairy cows also in the affected states. And then we have a third study which has to do with testing the effectiveness of cooking beef patties to make sure that the cooking kills the virus. 
> 
> So for the first one, which is the retail samples, the samples have been collected. They're currently at the lab NVSL, and we don't have the results yet. We will be sharing them with everybody as soon as they are available.
> 
> For the second study-- and if any of those samples become positive, we would actually have to do a calculations to see if what we find is live virus or not.
> 
> For this second study, the beef muscle from culled cows, we're collecting that for research purposes and to make sure that the virus is not spread throughout the entire animal. 
> 
> And for the third one, the cooking beef study, we're basically cooking beef patties at three different temperatures to document that cooking kills the virus. Again, I want to emphasize, we are pretty sure that the meat supply is safe. We're doing this just to enhance our scientific knowledge, to make sure that we have additional data points to make that statement. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [00:43:11]
> 
> So just to be clear monitoring, what I'm referring to monitoring, really is about a sort of symptom monitoring, and this is very similar to what happens in the setting of a poultry outbreak. 
> 
> And so the state health department has various systems that they use to monitor the health of individuals who are exposed. It can range from individual conversations on the phone, texts, apps, platforms for folks to text in on their symptoms. 
> 
> So I think that generally the way that this goes is that, when a herd is detected, the state interacts with their agricultural colleagues, as well as the farms, and then reaches out to the farms to make sure that whichever monitoring is the most appropriate for the setting and system that the state uses is the one that they use to monitor the health of workers exposed on the farm.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:46:18] 
> 
> For Dr Prater, have you been able to trace back how the H5N1 positives ended up in retail milk? I mean, is this coming from asymptomatic cows?
> 
> And for Dr. Sifford, given from what you're hearing from producers, do you think it's possible we're past the peak in places like Northwest Texas?
> 
> Don Prater, FDA [00:46:41]
> 
> So, FDA is working with our federal partners to analyze the initial data that we've collected through this survey of retail milk. 
> 
> We recognize that processors can receive milk from hundreds of different farms, which may cross state lines. We would defer to USDA  to speak about anything on the assessment of the current animal health epidemiologic situation. 
> 
> So we're continuing to look at this information and we'll be sharing any further analysis as we have it. Thank you.
> 
> Rosemary Sifford, USDA [00:47:14]
> 
> Yep. And this is Rosemary Siford with USDA. We do-- all of the evidence from our epidemiologic work, as well as our genomic sequencing, indicates that there was a single spillover event in that Texas panhandle region. And so we-- that event has passed and we do not see any evidence of additional spillover events.
> 
> Our work, through the testing for movement, will give us a more clear picture of any herds that might be still affected, but asymptomatic at this point.
> 
> ...
> 
> Vivien Dugan, CDC [00:49:03] 
> 
> I think that this would be an interagency discussion, but the general aspects that we always look for, not just for making a vaccine recommendation or in that space is changes in the genetic code, the genetic and antigenic properties of the viruses that are circulating, any changes that would impact our current countermeasures, so CVVs, candidate vaccine viruses, our antiviral medications, as well as our diagnostics, and also any changes in the virus that are circulating that would suggest better adaptation to mammals. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Rosemary Sifford, USDA [00:50:52]
> 
> The initial spillover event in that geographic region likely was not an individual herd, but a number of herds in that region. And then animals from those herds moving to other herds in other states were the initial movement of the virus. 
> 
> And then there has been subsequent movement from those subsequently affected herds. So not that-- not that there was a single herd, but a group of herds in that region that were where the original spillover event occurred.
> 
> ...
> 
> Don Prater, FDA [00:52:54]
> 
> So we are continuing to analyze the results of the retail milk survey. So just a reminder that we identified some PCR positives, and we followed up with the, a inoculation test that did not detect any live viable virus. So that's an important point. 
> 
> We are analyzing the information that we acquired from tha survey. It's important to point out that milk purchased in a particular state doesn't mean that it was produced or processed in that state. In fact, milk could be from cows on a farm a few states away, processed, pasteurized in a different state, and available for purchasing in yet another state. 
> 
> So we are continuing to look at that analysis. We're sharing that with our federal partners. And we will have something more to say on that in the days to come.
> 
> ...
> 
> Don Prater, FDA [01:02:42]
> 
> We are looking at that as part of our studies to validate the pasteurization parameters. So it's important that we have some indication of what viral load might actually be sent to a pasteurizer so that we can assess the effectiveness of the pasteurization criteria. 
> 
> So we are looking at that through a collaboration with our state partners.
