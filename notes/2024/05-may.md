## USDA spokesperson on H5N1 testing in ground beef

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesperson
- **Date:** received May 1, 2024

> From: Tin, Alex <TinA@cbsnews.com>
> 
> Can you clarify which states the samples were from? 
> 
> Does USDA plan to test additional samples from future states with infections?
> 
> ...
> 
> From: SM.OC.Press <Press@usda.gov>
> 
> The samples were collected from 8 of the affected states - all except Colorado as the samples were collected prior to Colorado having any confirmed affected herds.
> 
> In regard to your second question, I would point you to the two additional studies and we will share results when we have them. 

## North Carolina's agriculture department on asymptomatic cow

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services spokesperson Heather Overton
- **Date:** received May 1, 2024

> The herd remains asymptomatic for the disease being attributed to HPAI across the country. Asymptomatic for lactating cattle would mean that they are actively lactating.

## Ohio's agriculture department on H5N1 testing in milk

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** Ohio Department of Agriculture spokesperson Meghan Harshbarger
- **Date:** received May 1, 2024

> The Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) is not collecting samples or sampling retail milk in Ohio. The FDA is sampling retail milk from a limited set of geographically targeted areas as part of its national commercial milk sampling study in coordination with USDA, though the targeted areas are unknown to ODA.

## Utah's agriculture department on H5N1 trace back in milk

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** Utah Department of Agriculture and Food spokesperson Bailee Woolstenhulme
- **Date:** received May 1, 2024

> The short answer is yes, it would eventually be able to be traced back to the affected herd. 
> 
> This would take extensive testing to trace it that far. We would be able to trace a particular gallon of milk back to what is called a "bulk tank", which is a tank of milk that is delivered to the bottling source. These bulk tanks include milk from multiple dairies, so we would have to test cows from all of the dairies whose milk was in the bulk tank.

## Press briefing hosted by HHS about avian influenza

- **Source:** conference call
- **Attribution:** hosted by the Department of Health and Human Services
- **Date:** occurred May 1, 2024

> Don Prater, FDA [00:16:30]
> 
> These additional preliminary results further affirm the safety of the U.S. commercial milk supply. 
> 
> The FDA is continuing to identify additional products that we may test. We're also continuing to test samples of pooled, raw milk that has been routed to pasteurization and processing for commercial use. This will be used as a basis to characterize potential virus levels that pasteurization may encounter and will be used to inform our studies to further validate pasteurization. 
> 
> These important efforts are ongoing and we're committed to sharing additional testing results as soon as possible. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Rosemary Sifford, USDA [00:26:01]
> 
> Some of the patterns that we've talked about before continue to hold true. It appears that there is a single spillover event in the Texas panhandle geographic region from wild birds into dairy cattle. The wild birds are believed to be the initial source of the infection in dairy cattle, and then cattle movements spread the virus into other dairy cattle herds, and then subsequently into poultry flocks.
> 
> Affected herds are still seeing approximately 10% of the herd that display symptoms, and those cattle that display symptoms generally return to near their previous production levels, after they recover from the virus, which is taking around two weeks. We also continue to see that most cows do recover with palliative treatment with little or no associated mortality. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Rosemary Sifford, USDA [00:33:25]
> 
> Our focus is on identifying the currently affected herds and being able to work with them to eradicate the virus from the herd. But we do have plans to do some serologic testing to try to understand the overall scope including previously infected herds.
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [00:34:58]
> 
> The number of people who are being monitored at any one time tends to be very dynamic. So as you know, you've heard from Dr. Sifford, as herds resolved their illness, the monitoring period for people also goes away. 
> 
> So I think we-- I'll start by saying, our local partners have been working to monitor over a hundred people and, again, the testing number is dynamic, but again, it's over 20 people who have been tested. It's around 25, but again, that number is dynamic because, as they're monitoring, there's a very low threshold for individuals to get tested. 
> 
> I don't have in front of me how many folks had conjunctivitis, in terms of the folks who have been tested. I don't know the answer to that question at this time.
> 
> ...
> 
> Don Prater, FDA [00:37:27]
> 
> We are aware, because there are so many different dairy products, there are probably a few more products that we would look at just so that we make sure that we've got a good national sample. And so any additional results we will make available as soon as they become, uh, available to us.
> 
> ...
> 
> Emilio Esteban, FSIS [00:40:30]
> 
> We are very confident in the meat supply that it is safe. There's a lot of inspection process that we have right now that make sure that each animal gets inspected before slaughter and all cattle cartridges must pass inspection after slaughter, before they go into the food supply. 
> 
> So as far as the testing is concerned, we are doing three separate sampling efforts. The first one is we collected ground beef at retail from the affected states. The second is we are testing beef muscle samples from culled dairy cows also in the affected states. And then we have a third study which has to do with testing the effectiveness of cooking beef patties to make sure that the cooking kills the virus. 
> 
> So for the first one, which is the retail samples, the samples have been collected. They're currently at the lab NVSL, and we don't have the results yet. We will be sharing them with everybody as soon as they are available.
> 
> For the second study-- and if any of those samples become positive, we would actually have to do a calculations to see if what we find is live virus or not.
> 
> For this second study, the beef muscle from culled cows, we're collecting that for research purposes and to make sure that the virus is not spread throughout the entire animal. 
> 
> And for the third one, the cooking beef study, we're basically cooking beef patties at three different temperatures to document that cooking kills the virus. Again, I want to emphasize, we are pretty sure that the meat supply is safe. We're doing this just to enhance our scientific knowledge, to make sure that we have additional data points to make that statement. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [00:43:11]
> 
> So just to be clear monitoring, what I'm referring to monitoring, really is about a sort of symptom monitoring, and this is very similar to what happens in the setting of a poultry outbreak. 
> 
> And so the state health department has various systems that they use to monitor the health of individuals who are exposed. It can range from individual conversations on the phone, texts, apps, platforms for folks to text in on their symptoms. 
> 
> So I think that generally the way that this goes is that, when a herd is detected, the state interacts with their agricultural colleagues, as well as the farms, and then reaches out to the farms to make sure that whichever monitoring is the most appropriate for the setting and system that the state uses is the one that they use to monitor the health of workers exposed on the farm.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:46:18] 
> 
> For Dr Prater, have you been able to trace back how the H5N1 positives ended up in retail milk? I mean, is this coming from asymptomatic cows?
> 
> And for Dr. Sifford, given from what you're hearing from producers, do you think it's possible we're past the peak in places like Northwest Texas?
> 
> Don Prater, FDA [00:46:41]
> 
> So, FDA is working with our federal partners to analyze the initial data that we've collected through this survey of retail milk. 
> 
> We recognize that processors can receive milk from hundreds of different farms, which may cross state lines. We would defer to USDA  to speak about anything on the assessment of the current animal health epidemiologic situation. 
> 
> So we're continuing to look at this information and we'll be sharing any further analysis as we have it. Thank you.
> 
> Rosemary Sifford, USDA [00:47:14]
> 
> Yep. And this is Rosemary Siford with USDA. We do-- all of the evidence from our epidemiologic work, as well as our genomic sequencing, indicates that there was a single spillover event in that Texas panhandle region. And so we-- that event has passed and we do not see any evidence of additional spillover events.
> 
> Our work, through the testing for movement, will give us a more clear picture of any herds that might be still affected, but asymptomatic at this point.
> 
> ...
> 
> Vivien Dugan, CDC [00:49:03] 
> 
> I think that this would be an interagency discussion, but the general aspects that we always look for, not just for making a vaccine recommendation or in that space is changes in the genetic code, the genetic and antigenic properties of the viruses that are circulating, any changes that would impact our current countermeasures, so CVVs, candidate vaccine viruses, our antiviral medications, as well as our diagnostics, and also any changes in the virus that are circulating that would suggest better adaptation to mammals. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Rosemary Sifford, USDA [00:50:52]
> 
> The initial spillover event in that geographic region likely was not an individual herd, but a number of herds in that region. And then animals from those herds moving to other herds in other states were the initial movement of the virus. 
> 
> And then there has been subsequent movement from those subsequently affected herds. So not that-- not that there was a single herd, but a group of herds in that region that were where the original spillover event occurred.
> 
> ...
> 
> Don Prater, FDA [00:52:54]
> 
> So we are continuing to analyze the results of the retail milk survey. So just a reminder that we identified some PCR positives, and we followed up with the, a inoculation test that did not detect any live viable virus. So that's an important point. 
> 
> We are analyzing the information that we acquired from tha survey. It's important to point out that milk purchased in a particular state doesn't mean that it was produced or processed in that state. In fact, milk could be from cows on a farm a few states away, processed, pasteurized in a different state, and available for purchasing in yet another state. 
> 
> So we are continuing to look at that analysis. We're sharing that with our federal partners. And we will have something more to say on that in the days to come.
> 
> ...
> 
> Don Prater, FDA [01:02:42]
> 
> We are looking at that as part of our studies to validate the pasteurization parameters. So it's important that we have some indication of what viral load might actually be sent to a pasteurizer so that we can assess the effectiveness of the pasteurization criteria. 
> 
> So we are looking at that through a collaboration with our state partners.
