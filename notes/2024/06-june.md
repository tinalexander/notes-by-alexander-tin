## Lykos Therapeutics on FDA advisory committee meeting on MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD

- **Source:** emailed statement

- **Date:** received June 4, 2024

Today was an important day as the FDA Advisory Committee panel discussed MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD. This meeting was unprecedented in many ways including that it is atypical for an Advisory Committee to review an application that combines a drug and psychological intervention. In addition, this would be the first psychedelic-assisted therapy, if approved. While we are disappointed in the vote, we are committed to continuing to collaborate with the FDA with their ongoing review of our NDA over the coming weeks. It is important to note that the FDA is not bound by PDAC’s guidance but takes its advice into consideration. Today’s discussion made clear that there is an urgent need for new, effective and accessible therapies to address this unmet need for those living with PTSD. We are in ongoing discussions with the FDA about a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program, however, that has not yet been fully defined. Part of the purpose of the meeting today was to help inform this REMS program so we can continue to collaborate with the FDA to define the key elements. We will also work with the FDA to determine the most appropriate post-marketing plans to address the outstanding questions raised today, including how best to support the responsible integration of MDMA-assisted therapy into the healthcare system. If FDA-approved, prescription MDMA-assisted therapy will be launched with careful consideration of its potential benefits and risks, in accordance with established medical guidelines, protocols and quality standards.

> Amy Laverdiere, Lykos Therapeutics [09:24:54] 
> 
> MDMA is not a new drug, and while it can misunderstood due to its illicit counterpart, it actually has a well documented history in the psychiatric field.
> 
> In the 1970s and early 1980s, MDMA was used in conjunction with talk therapy by mental health providers since research suggested MDMA allowed patients with psychiatric disorders to access, process and communicate difficult emotions and experiences. 
> 
> It's been documented about 4,000 people have been administered MDMA in earlier clinical practice. In addition, about 2,000 participants have been included in more recent research studies. This historical experience along with an extensive library of published literature, informs the design of our clinical program. 
> 
> MDMA-AT has been studied across 17 clinical trials. Throughout clinical development, we've worked in collaboration with the FDA. A special protocol assessment for our two nearly identical pivotal studies, MAPP 1 and MAPP 2, was agreed in 2017.
> 
> Due to the seriousness of PTSD and the encouraging preliminary phase two data, MDMA-AT received breakthrough therapy drug designation that same year and the NDA was submitted in 2023 and granted priorly review.
> 
> ...
> 
> Amy Laverdiere, Lykos Therapeutics [09:13:40]
> 
> MDMA is entactogen that has the potential to be a powerful disease modifier. While the specific mechanisms are not completely understood, this in the brain, MDMA is thought to be monoamine reuptake inhibitor and releaser. 
> 
> We know psychotherapy can be effective, but only if patients are able to tolerate the treatment. The available data and mechanism of action suggest that MDMA catalyzes the effectiveness of psychotherapy by facilitating memory recollection and extending the patient's window of tolerance for revisiting distressing thoughts or experiences.
> 
> Studies with MDMA show improved self awareness and prosocial effects that enhance the therapeutic alliance between the patient and their therapist. By leveraging the effects of MDMA, individuals are more open to the potential benefits of psychotherapy. This psychological intervention includes aspects of established therapeutic approaches. 
> 
> This combination of MDMA plus psychological intervention provides patients with an acute treatment to reduce the symptoms associated with PTSD.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr Alia Lilienstein, Lykos Therapeutics [09:36:54]
> 
> MDMA has a moderately high potential for abuse. Importantly, however, illicit MDMA use is known to be primarily episodic and rarely results in substance use disorders. 
> 
> That is likely because MDMA is primarily serotonergic in action and it's unlikely produce physical dependence or withdrawal syndrome. This distinguishes it from typical psychostimulants, which primarily activates the dopamine system.
> 
> The morbidity and mortality associated with illicit MDMA is considerably lower than methamphetamines, similar to amphetamines, and higher than methylphenidate. 
> 
> While use of illicit MDMA cannot be completely prevented, approval of a controlled product provides the opportunity to regulate and monitor the field to a greater extent than what is currently possible. 
> 
> We're working with FDA to develop a REMS program, to evaluate and mitigate the risk of serious harm resulting from patient impairment. According to the proposed REMS, MDMA will only be dispensed in certified healthcare settings, and only with evidence of safe use conditions. 
> 
> This includes training for prescribers, pharmacists and therapists, and patients will be counseled to support safe use. 
> 
> Patients will be monitored during and after the session and will be required to be enrolled in midomefetamine drug registry.
> 
> Beyond the REMS, we're working with agency to develop a comprehensive plan to mitigate risk and translate the positive benefit risk of MDMA assisted therapy observed in the clinical trial setting to clinical care post approval. 
> 
> The mitigation efforts address each of the identified or potential risks. They include patient monitoring, appropriate labeling, prescriber educating, including appropriate selection of patients, and therapist training on patient monitoring for these risks. 
> 
> We also have additional efforts to support use in clinical practice. We plan to initially work with a limited number of sites that take specific steps to put the staff and processes in place to effectively and safely deliver MDMA assisted therapy. 
> 
> The basic premise of this treatment approach is that the psychological component is important. To support MDMA use in clinical practice, we will provide training for therapists on the treatment approach used in the phase three clinical trials. 
> 
> Furthermore, the medication for this acute treatment will be supplied in single dose packaging, further limiting nonmedical use and medication errors.
> 
> To conclude, overall, three total doses of MDMA were well tolerated. The adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of MDMA, with mostly mild to moderate and transient adverse events. No patients assigned MDMA died or experienced a serious adverse event in our pivotal studies. 
> 
> In addition, the risk can be appropriately managed and mitigated with proposed labeling and REMS. 
> 
> The favorable safety profile observed in the clinical program will translate to practice if approved due the inherent safeguards of an acute treatment with controlled distribution. 
> 
> Lastly, we agree with the agency that additional postmarketing studies such as laboratory safety data collection can further inform patients and providers while the benefit risk of this treatment is well characterized our clinical development program. 
> 
> We recognize more can be learned in a real world setting. We acknowledge the need to move forward with care and caution to bring this new tool to patients suffering from this serious and life-threatening condition.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr Kelley O'Donnell, NYU Langone (for Lykos Therapeutics) [09:41:39]
> 
> This treatment is under a lot scrutiny right now. PTSD patients are a genuinely vulnerable population and some of the strengths of MDMA may also represent challenges moving forward.
> 
> Careful screening, education, and monitoring patients and rigorous training of licensed providers will be essential for mitigating those risks. 
> 
> But the complexity of this treatment, like the complexity of the PTSD population, should not preclude approval because it's clear that MDMA assisted therapy would be a welcome addition to the available options. 
> 
> I've seen first hand how the intensive treatment can be lifesaving for some, including some who haven't benefited from conventional approaches at all. 
> 
> This need is, of course, all the more urgent, because despite the seriousness of this disease, we haven't seen a new pharmacologic intervention for PTSD in decades. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [10:30:31]
> 
> So there was a recent, fairly high profile ICER review, with claims that there was a misconduct during the clinical trials. Lykos responded really quickly to that, with a public letter. 
> 
> My question is number one, when was Lykos first made aware of these allegations and number two, what steps did Lykos take to investigate and rule out these occurred? Because your letter indicated there was any denial of such conduct. 
> 
> Did you do an internal investigation? Did you hire a third party often to come into investigate? Can you can speak to that?
> 
> Dr Alia Lilienstein, Lykos Therapeutics
> 
> The company was initially made aware of this event in late 2018. And an investigation was undertaken internally in the company, to both understand what had happened and improve any processes within the company to prevent this in the future. 
> 
> It's never okay for a care provider to cross boundaries. It's unethical behavior, and it's malpractice.
> 
> We work with licensed healthcare providers now, only, and they're trained, in addition through our therapy training program, to understand how the drug may impact boundary setting for patients and to reinforce upholding boundaries on their part as well.
> 
> Question
> 
> So in addition to the boundary violations, I think that is going to be a big part of the conversation later on, but there were these allegations that some folks, subjects, were discouraged from participating in MPLONG, and based on your briefing document, it appears that patients either were enrolled in MPLONG or by themselves decided not to. 
> 
> There was no suggestion that they were excluded by the principal investigators, but again, allegations from the ICER review, suggesting again, unsubstantiated claims of subjects stating that they were discouraged from participating in MPLONG study.
> 
> Were those things investigated? 
> 
> Dr Alia Lilienstein, Lykos Therapeutics
> 
> Yes, those were investigated as well. 
> 
> And all participants who were interested in participating were given the opportunity to review consent and some chose not to participate, after reviewing consent, but otherwise everyone was given the opportunity. 
> 
> Question 
> 
> Okay. So my understanding is that no subjects were excluded based off of one of the second criteria, which was, if there were any problems that the principal investigator identified, that would make participation in MPLONG problematic?
> 
> Dr Alia Lilienstein, Lykos Therapeutics
> 
> There was at least one participant I'm aware of who, because they were doing so poorly, felt like that participation in the study would be really negatively impacting for them, but they were-- a conversation was had.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [09:55:15]
> 
> The first is related to the controlled distribution pathway, and I think I want a little bit more detail on if I'm a patient, how am I obtaining the medicine or controlled substance, and then how is it being administered? So that's the first question walking me through that controlled distribution pathway. 
> 
> And then the second is under the mitigation strategies. There was a mention of limited rollout. And so can you walk me through what limited rollout means and what metrics of success you would use to then expand access, please? Thank you. 
> 
> Amy Laverdiere, Lykos Therapeutics
> 
> Based on the parameters of the proposed REMS, which we're still developing with input from FDA, the dispensation would only take place in certified healthcare settings that also have demonstrated evidence of safe use conditions. 
> 
> So by controlled distribution, what we mean is that there would be a limited number of pharmacies. They would either have to be on site at the certified healthcare setting, or similar type of distribution approach. 
> 
> There are additional restrictions on compounds that are dependent on their ultimate scheduling by DEA. So there's still some details that need to be worked out in terms of what is completely compliant with both FDA expectations and DEA regulations, and that's something we're actively engaged on working on with both FDA and DEA. 
> 
> So it's something that will follow all the requirements that apply, depending on how the scheduling goes.
> 
> In terms of how the product is administered, this would only be administered in these certified healthcare settings that have the appropriate personnel and plans in place to conduct the patient monitoring, deliver the psychological intervention, and also have plans in place for medical escalation.
> 
> And, in terms of the limited rollout, what we intended is that we would start out with a smaller number of commercial sites that were able to meet the requirements of this certified healthcare setting, safety conditions, in order to essentially pilot what our risk mitigation procedures are able to detect and submit reports to the agency for those REMS assessments on the required schedule.
> 
> The metrics for how we would expand on patient access are something that we're also still developing. However, we strongly believe that patient access is very important. And as a result, we're envisioning this as a staged rollout. 
> 
> So although we may start with limited number of sites initially, after demonstration of appropriate risk mitigation, we would plan to expand from there. 
> 
> Question
> 
> Thank you. So just as a follow up and knowing that the REMS program and logistics still need to be worked out a little bit, but it would be feasible or possible, in the sponsor's mind that you go to one of these pharmacies, be dispensed one dose, and then take that with you to the therapy session. Is that correct? 
> 
> Amy Laverdiere, Lykos Therapeutics
> 
> The dispensation would have to happen at the certified healthcare setting.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr David Millis, FDA [11:28:25]
> 
> However, in reviewing the clinical study reports submitted with the application, we noticed a striking lack of abuse related adverse events. 
> 
> When we followed up with the applicant about their abuse potential assessment methodology, they clarified that they did not systematically collect abuse related adverse events, as advised in the guidance. Rather, they only documented events characterized as unfavorable. Next slide. 
> 
> This lack of systematic collection of positive events is a major concern because this is key data that would help us characterize the central nervous system effects of the drug. As a result of not having this data, our ability to properly describe the expected frequency and severity of these events in product labeling is affected. 
> 
> For instance, although we may be able to include a general description and warnings and precautions of known effects of  midomafetamine based on literature, we have no verbatim adverse event terms, so no descriptions of the  midomafetamine experience in participant's own words.
> 
> This information could have helped us to determine the best language to describe these effects in the prescribing information. Further, there is no data to quantify the frequency of euphoria or other abuse related events in the adverse reaction section of the labeling. 
> 
> We also don't know when participants began to feel the effects of midomafetamine, nor when those effects resolved. This data could help inform recommendations related to appropriate monitoring duration and assessment of discharge readiness after medication sessions. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr David Millis, FDA [11:31:18]
> 
> Finally, during our last few meetings with the applicant, we noticed some additional review concerns.
> 
> During a breakthrough therapy advice meeting in September 2022, we noted that the safety database for the development program would be considered inadequate if the drug required chronic or chronic intermittent administration to maintain a treatment effect. 
> 
> This question of durability is relevant here because PTSD is a chronic condition. Any proposed treatment for PTSD should take this factor into account. 
> 
> The applicant proposed to address this question by providing the results of their exploratory follow up observational study MPLONG, which consisted of a single follow up assessment of participants from MAPP1 and MAPP2, at least six months after the last dosing session. 
> 
> During the meeting with the applicant, we noted that MPLONG was likely inadequate to fully address the question of durability of effect, but the agency would review the results with an NDA submission. At the pre NDA meeting, the agency noted that a risk evaluation and strategy or REMS would likely be required if this drug were to be approved, but that the specific risks to be mitigated by any proposed REMS would be a matter of review. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr David Millis, FDA [11:34:51]
> 
> The three medication sessions lasted at least eight hours a piece. The psychological intervention during the medication sessions consisted of general psychological support, as well as observation for safety purposes. Direct therapy was minimal. 
> 
> After each dosing session, there were three integrative sessions for a total of nine integrative sessions over the course of the study. The purpose of the integrative sessions was to help the participants describe their experience of the medication sessions, particularly the experience of remembering trauma. 
> 
> These were the main sessions with a more primary psychotherapeutic interaction occurred.
> 
> However, the content or approach of these integrated sessions was not standardized in the treatment manuals, and was mainly left up to the individual therapist. The manual provided general guidelines, orienting the therapist to an appropriate therapeutic stance towards the participants in setting, but not being directive or specific in terms of the content or approach of those therapy sessions. 
> 
> The approach to therapy was not standardized and could vary considerably, from therapists to therapists. Next slide. 
> 
> Overall, we know that is difficult then to assess how the psychological intervention provided by the applicant in the studies contributed to the overall treatment effect and results. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr David Millis, FDA [11:36:49]
> 
> And as noted already, we do not regulate therapy as a rule, in terms of its specific content or details. 
> 
> Labeling regulations allow for specification that a drug should be used only in conjunction with another mode of therapy, but that generally requires evidence that the other mode of therapy is necessary to achieve a treatment effect.
> 
> Under a REMS, we can require monitoring to ensure a patient's safety, but a REMS cannot dictate that a patient is offered or engages in psychotherapy. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Olivia Morgan, FDA [11:50:00]
> 
> One limitation of the study is the variable timing of the long term follow up visit one. The visit occurred at least six months, but up to two years, after the last dose in the parent study.
> 
> MAPP1 was conducted before MAPP2, and there was a longer lag time between MAPP1 and MPLONG, so the long term follow up assessment was generally later for those participants. Next slide. 
> 
> Another limitation of MPLONG is that some participants reported using non study drug interventions in the interim period between the parent study and MPLONG. Participants from MAPP 1 and MAPP 2 reported using ketamine, the psychedelic MEO DMT, or illicit MDMA.
> 
> The number of participants entering MPLONG from MAPP 1 and MAPP 2 who reported use of these psychoactive substances in the interim period between parent study and MPLONG is shown in this table. There were 17 participants in the drug arm and 13 participants in the placebo arm who reported the use of at least one of these psychoactive substances. It is also possible that there may be additional unreported nonstudy drug use in the interim period. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr David Millis, FDA [11:54:19]
> 
> Although we do have two positive studies, these results are in the context of dramatic functional unblinding. We know that it is difficult to control the impact of functional unblinding in psychedelic clinical trials. And the applicant did use blinded central raters to attempt to mitigate the impact of unblinding. 
> 
> Nonetheless, based on the results of the unblinding questionnaire in MAPP 2, it is clear that participants were aware of their treatment assignment, and that could impact their report of symptom control. 
> 
> As Dr. Farchione noted in her opening comments, a study that is functionally unblinded may still be able to be considered as an adequate and well controlled study. However, the potential influence of bias needs to be factored into the interpretation of the study results. 
> 
> It is important to consider if there were adequate methods to minimize bias, the magnitude of the treatment effects, the robustness of the study results, and what is known about the natural history of the condition. We also have some exploratory data suggesting that the effects of midomafetamine may be durable, but this is based on a single follow up assessment with a high degree of variability and time to visit.
> 
> Further because the applicants who enrolled in MPLONG had fared better in the parent study than those who did not enroll, we have concerns about selection bias. There also remains an unresolved question of the impact of non study drug use between the parent studies and MPLONG. 
> 
> Finally, the applicant has presented midomafetamine as an aid to psychotherapy. However, the role of psychotherapy and its contribution to the observed treatment response has not been formally evaluated. Also given the inherent flexibility in the therapy manual, there may have been considerable variability in therapeutic approach. However, there were no evaluations comparing whether these changes in therapeutic approach had any influence on efficacy. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr David Millis, FDA [12:08:36]
> 
> Our assessment of the rate of abuse potential adverse events remains limited. Thus, although we have enough information based on a review of the published literature and epidemiological data to craft warning language related to abuse potential, and prepare a scheduling recommendation for the DEA, we do not have information about the incidence of particular events that occurred in the clinical trials and will not be able to include those events in the adverse reaction section of labeling. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr David Millis, FDA [12:10:15]
> 
> Overall, the safety profile for midomafetamine observed in the development program is consistent with its known effects. 
> 
> However, certain risks cannot be fully characterized based on the safety data from this program. The assessment of cardiovascular risk, hepatotoxicity and abuse related adverse events did not adequately address these potential risks. 
> 
> In addition, because abuse related adverse events were not captured, if they were considered positive, favorable, or neutral, we do not have qualitative or quantitative information about the nature of the acute drug effects in this program, or about when those effects resolve. 
> 
> As a result, we have limited information to determine appropriate discharge criteria for after the medication sessions. 
> 
> Finally, we have a relatively small safety database in this program. This may be acceptable if we agree that the proposed three dose time limited treatment is effective for the treatment of PTSD and that the treatment effect is durable. But if we determine that additional courses of treatment are needed, the safety database may not be adequate to characterize the risk of chronic or chronic intermittent use. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr Tiffany Farchione, FDA [12:25:47]
> 
> There isn't a lot that I can say with regard to specific details of what we're looking into related to the ICER report versus just our usual standard inspections. 
> 
> We're certainly, I think we're all aware of the report. We certainly take those allegations very seriously and are quite concerned by them. We do have inspections ongoing at this point, but can't really speak to the details because those are ongoing.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr Tiffany Farchione, FDA [12:34:23]
> 
> Well, I mean, the difficult thing and something that you've just hit on very well is that we don't regulate psychotherapy and also, we don't really have any say in the design or the implementation of the particular therapy that is going to be used. 
> 
> We can say generally that this is something that would need to be administered in conjunction with a psychological intervention, but that's really the extent of what any labeling language would suggest.
> 
> And even when it comes to the parameters of the REMS, those are focused on safety and monitoring, not on the intervention that would occur at at the time. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Question
> [12:35:48]
> You mentioned earlier that inspections were ongoing into some of the claims about data manipulation and such. Is it possible if things were to be approved today that it could come out to market before those inspections are completed? 
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr Tiffany Farchione, FDA [12:36:08]
> 
> We would complete the inspections before taking action. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr Tiffany Farchione, FDA [12:41:57]
> 
> This is something unprecedented. So we certainly want to get as many opinions and as much input as we can on this product and on our decision making. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr Tiffany Farchione, FDA [12:46:07]
> 
> There is not a great answer to that question because again, even if there was a study looking specifically at the psychotherapy itself, that's not something that would fall under our purview. 
> 
> So in terms of approving a particular psychotherapy, that's not something that we would do.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr Tiffany Farchione, FDA [12:49:30]
> 
> In the clinical trials, we've only required one of the two monitors to have a license. What we have asked for, for the second monitor is, at least a bachelor's level degree and some experience in a mental health setting and so on. It primarily has to do with the concerns of balancing access as well. 
> 
> Walter Dunn, PADAC [12:49:59]
> 
> So again, reminding folks that that transgression happened with the unlicensed therapist, in the phase two trial, and again, thinking about clinical rollout, I know the sponsor mentioned that they would allow therapists who are in training. But again, thinking about, how should I put this delicately, for profit operations, which may misrepresent the training status of people who are unlicensed that they're potentially in training when they're actually not just to use the least resourced intensive personnel for their treatment, but it may, perhaps there needs to be, or can be more delineated guidelines as far as what that second therapist can be. 
> 
> My personal feeling is that both should be licensed. But that's for further discussions, but thank you.
> 
> ...
> 
> Elizabeth Joniak-Grant, PDAC [12:51:02]
> 
> I actually wanted to comment as well on the licensure. I think it's for FDA and people to remember that oftentimes if you have one person who's licensed and another person who is not a patient, will tend to see it as that person is sort of their advocate. 
> 
> So if something is going wrong or awry, well, someone would speak up on my behalf. It's, person A is doing something wrong. Person B would speak up on my behalf.
> 
> When you don't have people of equal status in that relationship that can cause all kinds of problems when you get power imbalances and hierarchy. I'm thinking about what if you have, a senior professor and you have somebody who's a graduate student who's, you know, in the process, they're going to call them out. 
> 
> And there's tons of instances of residents and fellows calling out bad behavior by clinicians all over the U.S., and nothing being done and nothing being investigated for years and years and years. 
> 
> So I think we have to really think long and hard about that. I definitely hear what everyone is saying in terms of access, but we have to, you know, it is a balance.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr Teresa Buracchio, FDA [12:57:26]
> 
> So we know that there is expectation bias and functional unblinding in this study. And it was something that we anticipated at the time of the review of these protocols. It was something that we actively discussed with the applicant during the special protocol assessment. 
> 
> And so, we are not surprised by the results of the functional unblinding study. It is something that was anticipated. So we have to consider, when we think about how to handle this, we know that there is bias to these studies. We have to consider, factor that into our consideration of the results and how we tend to think about the bias about how to handle bias when we're looking at the results is some of the things that were mentioned in the comments.

> In addition to all those actions, Dr. Morens wrote to Dr. Daszak quote, Peter from Tony's numerous recent comments to me, they are trying to protect you, end quote. Did you ever talk to Dr. Morens about Dr. Daszak or EcoHealth Alliance?

> Anthony Fauci [01:17:02]
> 
> I can tell you regard you what you said, I never spoke about protecting him. I mean, obviously we knew that Daszak was a grantee. So I may have mentioned and discussed Dr. Daszak because he's a grantee, but I never spoke that--

> No, I did not.
> 
> Rep Nicole Malliotakis [01:36:05]
> 
> Okay. Dr. Morens said in a May 2021 email, he indicated that he was connecting people to you in a quote secret back channel. Do you know what he was referring to?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:36:20]
> 
> I don't have any idea what he's talking about. There is no back channel at NIAID.
> 
> Rep Nicole Malliotakis [01:36:25]
> 
> Okay. There is, uh, he also sent another email that there is no worry about freedom of information act, I can send stuff to Tony on his private email. Did you communicate with anyone relating to anything regarding NIH or with Dr. Morens on a private email?

> I do not do government business on my private email.
> 
> Rep Nicole Malliotakis [01:36:48]
> 
> Okay. So was there-- so have you communicated with Dr. Morens via private email, even if it was not necessarily your definition of government business?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:36:57]
> 
> It might have been because as I mentioned in my opening statement, one of his functions is to write chapters, medical scientific chapters with me. So it is conceivable that I communicated with him on my private email when we were writing a chapter. And that was not official business.
