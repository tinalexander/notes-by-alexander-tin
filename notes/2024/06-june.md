> Amy Laverdiere, Lykos Therapeutics [09:24:54] 
> 
> MDMA is not a new drug, and while it can misunderstood due to its illicit counterpart, it actually has a well documented history in the psychiatric field.
> 
> In the 1970s and early 1980s, MDMA was used in conjunction with talk therapy by mental health providers since research suggested MDMA allowed patients with psychiatric disorders to access, process and communicate difficult emotions and experiences. 
> 
> It's been documented about 4,000 people have been administered MDMA in earlier clinical practice. In addition, about 2,000 participants have been included in more recent research studies. This historical experience along with an extensive library of published literature, informs the design of our clinical program. 
> 
> MDMA-AT has been studied across 17 clinical trials. Throughout clinical development, we've worked in collaboration with the FDA. A special protocol assessment for our two nearly identical pivotal studies, MAPP 1 and MAPP 2, was agreed in 2017.
> 
> Due to the seriousness of PTSD and the encouraging preliminary phase two data, MDMA-AT received breakthrough therapy drug designation that same year and the NDA was submitted in 2023 and granted priorly review.
> 
> ...
> 
> Amy Laverdiere, Lykos Therapeutics [09:13:40]
> 
> MDMA is entactogen that has the potential to be a powerful disease modifier. While the specific mechanisms are not completely understood, this in the brain, MDMA is thought to be monoamine reuptake inhibitor and releaser. 
> 
> We know psychotherapy can be effective, but only if patients are able to tolerate the treatment. The available data and mechanism of action suggest that MDMA catalyzes the effectiveness of psychotherapy by facilitating memory recollection and extending the patient's window of tolerance for revisiting distressing thoughts or experiences.
> 
> Studies with MDMA show improved self awareness and prosocial effects that enhance the therapeutic alliance between the patient and their therapist. By leveraging the effects of MDMA, individuals are more open to the potential benefits of psychotherapy. This psychological intervention includes aspects of established therapeutic approaches. 
> 
> This combination of MDMA plus psychological intervention provides patients with an acute treatment to reduce the symptoms associated with PTSD.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr Alia Lilienstein, Lykos Therapeutics [09:36:54]
> 
> MDMA has a moderately high potential for abuse. Importantly, however, illicit MDMA use is known to be primarily episodic and rarely results in substance use disorders. 
> 
> That is likely because MDMA is primarily serotonergic in action and it's unlikely produce physical dependence or withdrawal syndrome. This distinguishes it from typical psychostimulants, which primarily activates the dopamine system.
> 
> The morbidity and mortality associated with illicit MDMA is considerably lower than methamphetamines, similar to amphetamines, and higher than methylphenidate. 
> 
> While use of illicit MDMA cannot be completely prevented, approval of a controlled product provides the opportunity to regulate and monitor the field to a greater extent than what is currently possible. 
> 
> We're working with FDA to develop a REMS program, to evaluate and mitigate the risk of serious harm resulting from patient impairment. According to the proposed REMS, MDMA will only be dispensed in certified healthcare settings, and only with evidence of safe use conditions. 
> 
> This includes training for prescribers, pharmacists and therapists, and patients will be counseled to support safe use. 
> 
> Patients will be monitored during and after the session and will be required to be enrolled in midomefetamine drug registry.
> 
> Beyond the REMS, we're working with agency to develop a comprehensive plan to mitigate risk and translate the positive benefit risk of MDMA assisted therapy observed in the clinical trial setting to clinical care post approval. 
> 
> The mitigation efforts address each of the identified or potential risks. They include patient monitoring, appropriate labeling, prescriber educating, including appropriate selection of patients, and therapist training on patient monitoring for these risks. 
> 
> We also have additional efforts to support use in clinical practice. We plan to initially work with a limited number of sites that take specific steps to put the staff and processes in place to effectively and safely deliver MDMA assisted therapy. 
> 
> The basic premise of this treatment approach is that the psychological component is important. To support MDMA use in clinical practice, we will provide training for therapists on the treatment approach used in the phase three clinical trials. 
> 
> Furthermore, the medication for this acute treatment will be supplied in single dose packaging, further limiting nonmedical use and medication errors.
> 
> To conclude, overall, three total doses of MDMA were well tolerated. The adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of MDMA, with mostly mild to moderate and transient adverse events. No patients assigned MDMA died or experienced a serious adverse event in our pivotal studies. 
> 
> In addition, the risk can be appropriately managed and mitigated with proposed labeling and REMS. 
> 
> The favorable safety profile observed in the clinical program will translate to practice if approved due the inherent safeguards of an acute treatment with controlled distribution. 
> 
> Lastly, we agree with the agency that additional postmarketing studies such as laboratory safety data collection can further inform patients and providers while the benefit risk of this treatment is well characterized our clinical development program. 
> 
> We recognize more can be learned in a real world setting. We acknowledge the need to move forward with care and caution to bring this new tool to patients suffering from this serious and life-threatening condition.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dr Kelley O'Donnell, NYU Langone (for Lykos Therapeutics) [09:41:39]
> 
> This treatment is under a lot scrutiny right now. PTSD patients are a genuinely vulnerable population and some of the strengths of MDMA may also represent challenges moving forward.
> 
> Careful screening, education, and monitoring patients and rigorous training of licensed providers will be essential for mitigating those risks. 
> 
> But the complexity of this treatment, like the complexity of the PTSD population, should not preclude approval because it's clear that MDMA assisted therapy would be a welcome addition to the available options. 
> 
> I've seen first hand how the intensive treatment can be lifesaving for some, including some who haven't benefited from conventional approaches at all. 
> 
> This need is, of course, all the more urgent, because despite the seriousness of this disease, we haven't seen a new pharmacologic intervention for PTSD in decades. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [10:30:31]
> 
> So there was a recent, fairly high profile ICER review, with claims that there was a misconduct during the clinical trials. Lykos responded really quickly to that, with a public letter. 
> 
> My question is number one, when was Lykos first made aware of these allegations and number two, what steps did Lykos take to investigate and rule out these occurred? Because your letter indicated there was any denial of such conduct. 
> 
> Did you do an internal investigation? Did you hire a third party often to come into investigate? Can you can speak to that?
> 
> Dr Alia Lilienstein, Lykos Therapeutics
> 
> The company was initially made aware of this event in late 2018. And an investigation was undertaken internally in the company, to both understand what had happened and improve any processes within the company to prevent this in the future. 
> 
> It's never okay for a care provider to cross boundaries. It's unethical behavior, and it's malpractice.
> 
> We work with licensed healthcare providers now, only, and they're trained, in addition through our therapy training program, to understand how the drug may impact boundary setting for patients and to reinforce upholding boundaries on their part as well.
> 
> Question
> 
> So in addition to the boundary violations, I think that is going to be a big part of the conversation later on, but there were these allegations that some folks, subjects, were discouraged from participating in MPLONG, and based on your briefing document, it appears that patients either were enrolled in MPLONG or by themselves decided not to. 
> 
> There was no suggestion that they were excluded by the principal investigators, but again, allegations from the ICER review, suggesting again, unsubstantiated claims of subjects stating that they were discouraged from participating in MPLONG study.
> 
> Were those things investigated? 
> 
> Dr Alia Lilienstein, Lykos Therapeutics
> 
> Yes, those were investigated as well. 
> 
> And all participants who were interested in participating were given the opportunity to review consent and some chose not to participate, after reviewing consent, but otherwise everyone was given the opportunity. 
> 
> Question 
> 
> Okay. So my understanding is that no subjects were excluded based off of one of the second criteria, which was, if there were any problems that the principal investigator identified, that would make participation in MPLONG problematic?
> 
> Dr Alia Lilienstein, Lykos Therapeutics
> 
> There was at least one participant I'm aware of who, because they were doing so poorly, felt like that participation in the study would be really negatively impacting for them, but they were-- a conversation was had.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [09:55:15]
> 
> The first is related to the controlled distribution pathway, and I think I want a little bit more detail on if I'm a patient, how am I obtaining the medicine or controlled substance, and then how is it being administered? So that's the first question walking me through that controlled distribution pathway. 
> 
> And then the second is under the mitigation strategies. There was a mention of limited rollout. And so can you walk me through what limited rollout means and what metrics of success you would use to then expand access, please? Thank you. 
> 
> Amy Laverdiere, Lykos Therapeutics
> 
> Based on the parameters of the proposed REMS, which we're still developing with input from FDA, the dispensation would only take place in certified healthcare settings that also have demonstrated evidence of safe use conditions. 
> 
> So by controlled distribution, what we mean is that there would be a limited number of pharmacies. They would either have to be on site at the certified healthcare setting, or similar type of distribution approach. 
> 
> There are additional restrictions on compounds that are dependent on their ultimate scheduling by DEA. So there's still some details that need to be worked out in terms of what is completely compliant with both FDA expectations and DEA regulations, and that's something we're actively engaged on working on with both FDA and DEA. 
> 
> So it's something that will follow all the requirements that apply, depending on how the scheduling goes.
> 
> In terms of how the product is administered, this would only be administered in these certified healthcare settings that have the appropriate personnel and plans in place to conduct the patient monitoring, deliver the psychological intervention, and also have plans in place for medical escalation.
> 
> And, in terms of the limited rollout, what we intended is that we would start out with a smaller number of commercial sites that were able to meet the requirements of this certified healthcare setting, safety conditions, in order to essentially pilot what our risk mitigation procedures are able to detect and submit reports to the agency for those REMS assessments on the required schedule.
> 
> The metrics for how we would expand on patient access are something that we're also still developing. However, we strongly believe that patient access is very important. And as a result, we're envisioning this as a staged rollout. 
> 
> So although we may start with limited number of sites initially, after demonstration of appropriate risk mitigation, we would plan to expand from there. 
> 
> Question
> 
> Thank you. So just as a follow up and knowing that the REMS program and logistics still need to be worked out a little bit, but it would be feasible or possible, in the sponsor's mind that you go to one of these pharmacies, be dispensed one dose, and then take that with you to the therapy session. Is that correct? 
> 
> Amy Laverdiere, Lykos Therapeutics
> 
> The dispensation would have to happen at the certified healthcare setting.

> Anthony Fauci [00:57:18]
> 
> Another issue is that of Dr. David Morens, who has the title of senior advisor to the NIAID director, and who recently began, has been investigated for conduct unbecoming of a government official. Naturally, given his title, a connection is made to me. 
> 
> With respect to his recent testimony before this subcommittee, I knew nothing of Dr Morens' actions regarding Dr. Daszak, EcoHealth, or his emails. 
> 
> It is important to point out for the record that despite his title, and even though he was helpful to me in writing scientific papers, Dr. Morens was not an advisor to me on institute policy or other substantive issues.
> 
> At NIAID we had weekly executive committee meetings of the institute leadership and daily morning meetings of my immediate staff. And to the best of my recollection, he attended neither of these. 
> 
> Furthermore, his office is located in a different building from that of the NIAID director.
> 
> Finally, in a majority staff memorandum of May 22nd, 2024, there is a statement quote, Dr. Fauci may have conducted official business via personal email. 
> 
> Let me state for the record that, to the best of my knowledge, I have never conducted official business using my personal email. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:14:12]
> 
> Dr. Morens testified that he could walk into your office anytime he wanted to. Is that true?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:14:17]
> 
> No, that's not true. You don't just walk into the office. I mean, he's there, I mean, it's conceivable--
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:14:22]
> 
> Did he ever walk into your office?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:14:24]
> 
> I would say he did occasionally, but the idea-- can I finish the answer to you, sir?
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:14:29]
> 
> No, because I've got a lot of questions. 
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:14:30]
> 
> Okay. 
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:14:31]
> 
> Dr. Fauci, did you ever delete an official record?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:14:34]
> 
> No.
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:14:35]
> 
> Dr. Fauci, did you ever conduct official business via email
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:14:39]
> 
> To the best of my recollection and knowledge, I have never conducted official business via my private email.
> 
> ...
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:16:07]
> 
> On October 25th, 2021, Dr. Morens provided Dr. Daszak with advice regarding how to mislead NIH on EcoHealth's late progress report. Does that violate policy?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:16:19]
> 
> That was wrong and inappropriate and violated policy.
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:16:23]
> 
> On December 7th, 2021, Dr. Morens wrote to the chair of EcoHealth's board of directors to quote, put in a word for Dr. Daszak, does that violate policy?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:16:35]
> 
> He should not have done that, that was wrong.
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:16:38]
> 
> And that violates policy?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:16:39]
> 
> Well, I'm not sure of a specific policy, but I imagine it does violate policy. He should not have been doing that.
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:16:44]
> 
> In addition to all those actions, Dr. Morens wrote to Dr. Daszak quote, Peter from Tony's numerous recent comments to me, they are trying to protect you, end quote. Did you ever talk to Dr. Morens about Dr. Daszak or EcoHealth Alliance?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:17:02]
> 
> I can tell you regard you what you said, I never spoke about protecting him. I mean, obviously we knew that Daszak was a grantee. So I may have mentioned and discussed Dr. Daszak because he's a grantee, but I never spoke that--
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:17:17]
> 
> You're testifying that he just made that up?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:17:19]
> 
> Excuse me?
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:17:20]
> 
> You're testifying that, Dr Morens just made that up?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:17:24]
> 
> I don't know where he got that, but that's not true.
> 
> ...
> 
> Rep Nicole Malliotakis [01:35:57]
> 
> Dr. Fauci, did you delete any emails or records related to the Wuhan lab or the origins of the virus?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:36:04]
> 
> No, I did not.
> 
> Rep Nicole Malliotakis [01:36:05]
> 
> Okay. Dr. Morens said in a May 2021 email, he indicated that he was connecting people to you in a quote secret back channel. Do you know what he was referring to?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:36:20]
> 
> I don't have any idea what he's talking about. There is no back channel at NIAID.
> 
> Rep Nicole Malliotakis [01:36:25]
> 
> Okay. There is, uh, he also sent another email that there is no worry about freedom of information act, I can send stuff to Tony on his private email. Did you communicate with anyone relating to anything regarding NIH or with Dr. Morens on a private email?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:36:44]
> 
> I do not do government business on my private email.
> 
> Rep Nicole Malliotakis [01:36:48]
> 
> Okay. So was there-- so have you communicated with Dr. Morens via private email, even if it was not necessarily your definition of government business?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:36:57]
> 
> It might have been because as I mentioned in my opening statement, one of his functions is to write chapters, medical scientific chapters with me. So it is conceivable that I communicated with him on my private email when we were writing a chapter. And that was not official business.

## CDC spokesperson on sick passengers in Houston airport

- **Date:** received June 3, 2024

> CDC is aware of a flight from Vancouver, British Columbia, that arrived at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport on Friday, May 31.  Public health officers from CDC’s Houston Port Health Station worked with EMS to evaluate ill passengers on board. Most of the ill passengers reported mild GI symptoms. No passengers were noted to have a fever during the flight or upon public health assessment at landing. No passengers met CDC criteria for further public health follow-up. Passengers from the flight continued with their travel plans.
