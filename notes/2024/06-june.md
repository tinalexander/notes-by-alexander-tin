> Anthony Fauci [00:57:18]
> 
> Another issue is that of Dr. David Morens, who has the title of senior advisor to the NIAID director, and who recently began, has been investigated for conduct unbecoming of a government official. Naturally, given his title, a connection is made to me. 
> 
> With respect to his recent testimony before this subcommittee, I knew nothing of Dr Morens' actions regarding Dr. Daszak, EcoHealth, or his emails. 
> 
> It is important to point out for the record that despite his title, and even though he was helpful to me in writing scientific papers, Dr. Morens was not an advisor to me on institute policy or other substantive issues.
> 
> At NIAID we had weekly executive committee meetings of the institute leadership and daily morning meetings of my immediate staff. And to the best of my recollection, he attended neither of these. 
> 
> Furthermore, his office is located in a different building from that of the NIAID director.
> 
> Finally, in a majority staff memorandum of May 22nd, 2024, there is a statement quote, Dr. Fauci may have conducted official business via personal email. 
> 
> Let me state for the record that, to the best of my knowledge, I have never conducted official business using my personal email. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:14:12]
> 
> Dr. Morens testified that he could walk into your office anytime he wanted to. Is that true?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:14:17]
> 
> No, that's not true. You don't just walk into the office. I mean, he's there, I mean, it's conceivable--
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:14:22]
> 
> Did he ever walk into your office?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:14:24]
> 
> I would say he did occasionally, but the idea-- can I finish the answer to you, sir?
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:14:29]
> 
> No, because I've got a lot of questions. 
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:14:30]
> 
> Okay. 
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:14:31]
> 
> Dr. Fauci, did you ever delete an official record?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:14:34]
> 
> No.
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:14:35]
> 
> Dr. Fauci, did you ever conduct official business via email
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:14:39]
> 
> To the best of my recollection and knowledge, I have never conducted official business via my private email.
> 
> ...
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:16:07]
> 
> On October 25th, 2021, Dr. Morens provided Dr. Daszak with advice regarding how to mislead NIH on EcoHealth's late progress report. Does that violate policy?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:16:19]
> 
> That was wrong and inappropriate and violated policy.
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:16:23]
> 
> On December 7th, 2021, Dr. Morens wrote to the chair of EcoHealth's board of directors to quote, put in a word for Dr. Daszak, does that violate policy?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:16:35]
> 
> He should not have done that, that was wrong.
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:16:38]
> 
> And that violates policy?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:16:39]
> 
> Well, I'm not sure of a specific policy, but I imagine it does violate policy. He should not have been doing that.
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:16:44]
> 
> In addition to all those actions, Dr. Morens wrote to Dr. Daszak quote, Peter from Tony's numerous recent comments to me, they are trying to protect you, end quote. Did you ever talk to Dr. Morens about Dr. Daszak or EcoHealth Alliance?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:17:02]
> 
> I can tell you regard you what you said, I never spoke about protecting him. I mean, obviously we knew that Daszak was a grantee. So I may have mentioned and discussed Dr. Daszak because he's a grantee, but I never spoke that--
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:17:17]
> 
> You're testifying that he just made that up?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:17:19]
> 
> Excuse me?
> 
> Rep James Comer [01:17:20]
> 
> You're testifying that, Dr Morens just made that up?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:17:24]
> 
> I don't know where he got that, but that's not true.
> 
> ...
> 
> Rep Nicole Malliotakis [01:35:57]
> 
> Dr. Fauci, did you delete any emails or records related to the Wuhan lab or the origins of the virus?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:36:04]
> 
> No, I did not.
> 
> Rep Nicole Malliotakis [01:36:05]
> 
> Okay. Dr. Morens said in a May 2021 email, he indicated that he was connecting people to you in a quote secret back channel. Do you know what he was referring to?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:36:20]
> 
> I don't have any idea what he's talking about. There is no back channel at NIAID.
> 
> Rep Nicole Malliotakis [01:36:25]
> 
> Okay. There is, uh, he also sent another email that there is no worry about freedom of information act, I can send stuff to Tony on his private email. Did you communicate with anyone relating to anything regarding NIH or with Dr. Morens on a private email?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:36:44]
> 
> I do not do government business on my private email.
> 
> Rep Nicole Malliotakis [01:36:48]
> 
> Okay. So was there-- so have you communicated with Dr. Morens via private email, even if it was not necessarily your definition of government business?
> 
> Anthony Fauci [01:36:57]
> 
> It might have been because as I mentioned in my opening statement, one of his functions is to write chapters, medical scientific chapters with me. So it is conceivable that I communicated with him on my private email when we were writing a chapter. And that was not official business.
