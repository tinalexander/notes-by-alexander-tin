## FDA commissioner at gaggle, pull-aside after hearing

- **Source:** gaggle, pull-aside
- **Attribution:** Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Robert Califf
- **Date:** occurred December 5, 2024

> Question [00:02:17]
> 
> Do you have any big ticket items that you're trying to accomplish in the month and a half left that you have the FDA?
> 
> Robert Califf [00:02:23]
> 
> Well, some of them were here, front of package and healthy. The nicotine standard is another big one that's in play right now. You'll hear more about that.
> 
> And, this sounds kind of, so what, but we have many, many guidances that the industry is dependent on that need to get through the system.
> 
> Not because any one of them is-- but they're just making it possible for industry to do its work in a way that's safer and more effective.
> 
> So I wouldn't pick one of those specifically, a good example would be the issue of hair straightner and formaldehyde. It's a pretty basic thing.
> 
> So just needs to get done.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf [00:00:30]
> 
> It's very difficult to give a specific amount of money because the work needs to be adjusted for the specific purpose that Congress wants us to do, but in the area of chemical safety, it would at least take a doubling of the budget to just really begin to address the numerous chemicals that derived food and make sure that they're safe.
> 
> And when it comes to nutrition, we have a very meager budget for nutrition. Yet, as we discussed today, this is harming a lot of people, the food that they're eating. So it would a large amount if we really want to address nutrition.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:02:19]
> 
> Is it frustrating that only now food is such a big topic? I remember a year or two ago you were at hearings complaining nobody was asking you about nutrition. So is it frustrating that it's only a big issue now?
> 
> Robert Califf [00:02:30]
> 
> Well, in my job, I don't-- I can't allow myself to get frustrated, but this is the issue of nutrition and the diet of Americans has been a hot button issue for me for over two decades, because I'm a cardiologist. You see it. 
> 
> So it's great that now attention is coming to it. I'll just take it as a good thing that we're finally getting to where we need to be.

## Senate committee hearing with FDA officials

- **Attribution:** hosted by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
- **Date:** occurred December 5, 2024

> 10:06:10 AM SANDERS: Time is long overdue for us to pose some very simple questions, and that is what this hearing is about today. 
> 
> How did it happen that according to the CDC, the rate of childhood obesity in America has tripled since the 1970s. And it's gotten so bad that one out of every five children in our country is now obese. How has it happened that over 40 percent of adults in the United States today are obese?
> 
> In my view, the answers to these questions are not very complicated. 
> 
> For decades, Congress and the FDA have allowed large corporations to make huge profits by enticing children and adults to consume ultra processed foods and beverages loaded up with sugar, salt, and saturated fat. 
> 
> There is growing evidence, including testimony that we have heard right here in this committee, that these foods are deliberately deisgned to be addictive, similar to cigarettes and alcohol and lead to a higher rate of type two diabetes.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:18:31 AM CALIFF: While all the work FDA does is crucial, the greatest public health advancements we can make would be to improve the diet of Americans and eliminate the use of tobacco. 
> 
> The food we eat is contributing to America's unfortunate position with the lowest life expectancy among large high income countries. I want to stress, this, last place among large high income countries in life expectancy. 
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:21:24 AM CALIFF: There is good reason to be concerned about the chemicals that are routinely included in much of our food. 
> 
> FDA has limited resources to deal with this issue, despite repeated requests for funding for much needed additional experts to do the evaluations. 
> 
> There are years of work under each of these initiatives that are performed by highly qualified and dedicated staff in the face of multiple limitations in the existing science, extensive legal hurdles, and direct opposition from powerful industry forces.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:22:22 AM CALIFF: As you know, I'll be leaving FDA at the change of administrations.
> 
> But I can assure you that our people at FDA want to do more. And we need your partnership. 
> 
> As a cardiologist, I've spent most of my career dealing with the tragedy of premature death and disability. But my time in Washington has made me aware of how hard it is to address these policy issues. 
> 
> Our nation's complex financial and industrial interests combined with our national instinct to favor individual freedom to choose, even if the choice is one that impairs health, make it difficult to take actions that have been successfully deployed by many other countries. 
> 
> And I believe these differences directly lead to better health and longer life in every other large high-income country compared with ours. 
> 
> In my opinion, finding a better consensus on these issues in America, it's not just an opportunity, but a necessity for the future of our country.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:25:45 CALIFF: You asked, how long does it take? Let's talk about tobacco. 
> 
> We were instructed to do that many years ago. We have lost in court on that issue. And we're finally winning now, it looks like. 
> 
> But the point I want to make is, what sounds simple, given the current state of judicial affairs, First Amendment rights, the fact that corporations have the same rights as individuals, every little thing we do, unless specifically in detail instructed by Congress, it's not just that we lose in court, but we lose years when that happens. 
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:26:40 SANDERS: We have got to act. And have you pointed a finger at those people who are the cause of the problem? Have you had the courage to take on a very powerful food and beverage industry?
> 
> There are 15 teaspoons of sugar in this product. How many parents in America know this when they give it to their kids? Say, here, have a Coke. Go out and play ball. 
> 
> Have you done your job and your predecessors, not just you, have you done your job in alerting the American people to the danger and rallying members of Congress to stand up to the special interests who are causing these problems?
> 
> CALIFF: With all due respect, I've been working on this problem for all of my career. This is what I've done. And I think I have talked about this very specifically. 
> 
> I think we all wish that we had gotten to the goal sooner, that you described. I'm not contesting that.
> 
> But I do believe, in an appropriate discourse with this committee, we need to carefully reflect on the issues in play right now that would allow this to happen, and I'm really heartened to hear the bipartisan support for htis, because much of what we try to do, frankly, gets blocked along the way. 
> 
> ...
> 
> CALIFF: Well, I'm not going to contest your comment about the amount of money spent on lobbying. I think it's probably accurate. I don't have figures on that. 
> 
> But a lot of the changes, those of us who are interested in better health would like to make are blocked at the level of legislation, for reasons that you have to tell me.
> 
> SANDERS: But I'm still not hearing you. What is the reason that our kids are unhealthy? What role does this industry play? Even now, you're getting out of office. 
> 
> Are you prepared to tell us that this committee, this Congress needs to take on the food and beverage industry whose greed is destroying the health of millions of people?
> 
> CALIFF: Well, I'm not going to castigate the people that work in the food and beverage industry. They're not--
> 
> SANDERS: That is your job. 
> 
> CALIFF: No, it's not. It's not to castigate. It's to point out how to make progress in this area. 
> 
> We have an industry that if you tried to change it overnight, there are farmers all over the United States who would not be able to grow the crops they're currently growing. 
> 
> So there needs to be a plan and it needs to be implemented in a mature, thoughtful way across the country.
> 
> I'm 100 percent in favor of the change.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:30:58 JONES: So, Red 3, we have a petition in front of us to revoke the authorization for it, and we are hopeful that within the next few weeks, we will actually-- we will be acting on that petition and a decision should be forthcoming. 
> 
> TUBERVILLE: Tell us that process. How does that work? The timeline, you know, if we know something's deadly for anybody that ingests it. How do we continue just study that, and not just say, hey, enough is enough.
> 
> JONES: So Red 3 presents an interesting example for us. 
> 
> It is actually known to be cancererous in laboratory animals, rats. But the scientific consensus is that the mechanism of carcinogenicity in rats is not applicable in humans. 
> 
> However, under the FFDCA, which is the law that we implement, any chemical that is shown to be carcinogenic in animals or humans, or should I say humans or animals, cannot be authorized by FDA. It's called the Delaney Clause. 
> 
> And so even though we don't believe there is a risk to humans, under the Delaney Clause of the FFDCA, red dye because it is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals, should not be authorized.
> 
> And so that is what has been challenged FDA for many years is how to manage around the Delaney Clause where you have a scenario where, although there may be cancer evidence in animals, there is also evidence that is not harmful to humans.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:33:23 CALIFF: We have a very small staff that can do this based on the budget. We have repeatedly asked for better funding for chemical safety. 
> 
> I brought Mr. Jones in to head the human foods program because of his history of working on environmental issues, I think it is a huge priority. He's an expert in this. 
> 
> Please look at our request for funding for the people who do this work. 
> 
> Remember that when we do ban something, it will go to court. And if we don't have the scientific evidence, it will stand up in court, we will lose in court.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:34:19 JONES: The biggest distinction between the U.S. and Europe is that they have been doing post-market review of chemicals now for over 20 years. 
> 
> In the FDA, although we have authorization to do post-market reviews, there's no statutory mandate to do them. 
> 
> One of the things that Dr. Califf mentioned is that as part of this reorganization, we are dedicating an entire office whose job is to do post-market chemical reviews. 
> 
> But we are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized at some point in the past. 
> 
> We don't, but we are going to undertake it. But we are going to definitely struggle with the resources necessary to do that.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:35:08 CALIFF: There's a real lesson here from, I don't know if you eat Froot Loops. I grew up every once in a while eating Froot Loops. 
> 
> But there's a real lesson here, and I haven't verified this myself, but it's widely written that when the dyes that make Froot Loops bright were taken out for the reasons that you give, the sales went straight down and they were put back in. 
> 
> So as long as we have a consumer-driven system, where what people like in the short term is what drives the system, unless we have help from you all, that is clear direction from Congress, particularly given the recent Supreme Court decisions, it's going to be really hard for us to mandate things come off.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:42:38 CALIFF: Let me tell you, I'm hyper aware of this. 
> 
> With permission, I have a brother who has pancreatic cancer who was just in the hospital. I was there and he got one of the two bags of IV fluid he was supposed to get because of the shortage. 
> 
> So I'm very aware of it.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:56:54 CALIFF: One noticeable thing to me, and I readily admitted when I took the job, I was not an expert in food. I've learned a lot in my two stints at FDA. 
> 
> But one really big difference is, when the medical products industry does research by law, if it's done on human beings, it is made public. And we have access to it. And we look at the raw data and analyze it ourselves at the FDA. 
> 
> The food industry does massive amounts of research that we have no access to. And we don't know what they're doing. We don't know what's guiding their decisions. 
> 
> It would be a lot better if the research that was done on human beings by the food industry was made public. 
> 
> ...
> 
> 11:15:27 CALIFF: This is a systemic problem that does need to be addressed. And it would actually be great. 
> 
> I'm on record, I've been quoted on this. I've had this nightmare that I was head of this agency that my great-grandkids read about called the FDA, where a society let people gain essentially a pound of weight every year, and then to fix it, they invented a drug at $20,000 a year to try to deal with it. 
> 
> And that would be a very bad legacy to leave behind. So I hope this will be fixed.
> 
> ...
> 
> 11:38:15 MARKEY: We have a potential nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services who has talked a lot about nutrition and chronic disease. Some would say what he says on diet and importance of healthy foods is reasonable. 
> 
> However, one reasonable opinion does not qualify someone to run the United States Department of Health and Human Services. 
> 
> What should be disqualifying to run the Department of Health and Human Services, that oversees every aspect of our healthcare system and whose actions will impact healthcare costs, access and innovation, is a nominee who has been proposed by President Trump who has spread misinformation about vaccines and fluoridation of our water, questions the well-proven conclusions that HIV causes AIDS, and falsely claim that medication for depression is linked to mass shootings.
> 
> What should be disqualifying to run the Department of Health and Human Services is a history of spreading misinformation about public health measures like vaccines that result in a measles outbreak. For example, in the deaths of 83 people, many of whom were children and babies. 
> 
> If we are serious about addressing chronic disease. If we are serious about closing gaps in healthcare access and moving towards a healthier America, the Senate should only confirm nominees to serve in the Department of Health and Human Services who are prepared, qualified, and serious about the responsibility of their roles.
> 
> In my view, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has disqualified himself to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services.

## Ohio health department statement on pertussis

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Ohio Department of Health spokesperson
- **Date:** received December 5, 2024

> Pertussis can be cyclical. After seeing lower numbers of reported cases in the past few years -- during and after the COVID-19 pandemic -- nationally, pertussis is now returning to pre-pandemic trends.
> 
> Ohio is no different. So far this year, Ohio has seen over 1,200 cases. This is higher than we saw last year and is consistent with some years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
> 
> Between 2010 and 2014, for example, Ohio reported an average of 1,285 cases annually, including over 1,600 cases in 2013.
> 
> State data on pertussis and more than 100 other infectious diseases can be found on our dashboard, Summary of Infectious Diseases in Ohio.
> 
> You can sort the timeframe, specific disease, county and demographic profile. To find pertussis, under “Reportable Condition” unclick “all,” select pertussis from the dropdown menu, then click “Apply.”
> 
> We would recommend going back and selecting a longer timeframe, perhaps even back to 2001, the earliest data we have available, to see the longer-term trends for pertussis cases. Click on “epi curve” after you have selected a timeframe to see this.
> 
> The Ohio Department of Health (ODH) has been working with local health departments by providing guidance and support on responding to individual cases and outbreaks of pertussis.
> 
> ODH encourages individuals to stay up to date on vaccines to help prevent pertussis, which can be especially dangerous to infants. Additionally, everyone should stay home when they are sick, cover any coughs or sneezes, and wash their hands frequently.

## California health department statement on Raw Farm recall

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** California Department of Public Health spokesperson
- **Date:** received December 4, 2024

> QUESTION 1: Will CDPH test either of the positive samples to see if they are infectious? Or is it known if either are infectious? 
> 
> California has secured a broad, voluntary recall of all Raw Farm, LLC raw milk and cream products due to possible bird flu contamination. While no human bird flu cases associated with the product have been detected at this time, health experts have long warned consumers against consuming raw milk or raw milk products due to elevated risks of foodborne illness, including Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, toxin producing E. coli, Brucella, Campylobacter, and others. Raw milk products are not pasteurized, a heating process that kills bacteria and viruses such as bird flu.  
> 
> No human bird flu cases associated with the product have been confirmed to date, and the state is working closely with federal and local partners to investigate the situation and better understand how it might impact consumers. Bird flu virus levels have been demonstrated to be high in raw milk from infected cows, and sporadic human cases identified in workers in close contact with infected dairy cows and their milk indicate that raw milk is infectious to humans. 
> 
> QUESTION 2: Is it known if any of Raw Farm's products were sold outside of California?  
> 
> Federal law does not allow interstate sales of raw milk for human consumption, so the recalled product was only sold within California.  
> 
> It is possible that raw milk intended for pet consumption was sold to customers outside California. Interstate sales of raw milk for pets is legal, as long as vendors abide by the FDA pet food labeling requirements (21CFR Part 501), Raw milk for pets should be handled with the same caution as raw milk for human consumption.
> 
> QUESTION 3: Have any symptomatic cattle been identified so far at Raw Farm's premises
> 
> RESPONSE: As previously noted, please contact the California Department of Food and Agriculture for this question.

> The FDA and RAW FARM, LLC (f/k/a Organic Pastures Dairy Co., LLC) are involved in an ongoing enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, United States of America v. Organic Pastures Dairy Co., et al., 1:08-cv-1786 (E.D. Cal.). Per agency policy the FDA does not comment on possible, pending or ongoing litigation.
