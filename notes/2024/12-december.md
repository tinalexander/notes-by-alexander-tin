## California health department statement on Raw Farm recall

- **Source:** emailed statement

- **Date:** received December 4, 2024

> QUESTION 1: Will CDPH test either of the positive samples to see if they are infectious? Or is it known if either are infectious? 
> 
> California has secured a broad, voluntary recall of all Raw Farm, LLC raw milk and cream products due to possible bird flu contamination. While no human bird flu cases associated with the product have been detected at this time, health experts have long warned consumers against consuming raw milk or raw milk products due to elevated risks of foodborne illness, including Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, toxin producing E. coli, Brucella, Campylobacter, and others. Raw milk products are not pasteurized, a heating process that kills bacteria and viruses such as bird flu.  
> 
> No human bird flu cases associated with the product have been confirmed to date, and the state is working closely with federal and local partners to investigate the situation and better understand how it might impact consumers. Bird flu virus levels have been demonstrated to be high in raw milk from infected cows, and sporadic human cases identified in workers in close contact with infected dairy cows and their milk indicate that raw milk is infectious to humans. 
> 
> QUESTION 2: Is it known if any of Raw Farm's products were sold outside of California?  
> 
> Federal law does not allow interstate sales of raw milk for human consumption, so the recalled product was only sold within California.  
> 
> It is possible that raw milk intended for pet consumption was sold to customers outside California. Interstate sales of raw milk for pets is legal, as long as vendors abide by the FDA pet food labeling requirements (21CFR Part 501), Raw milk for pets should be handled with the same caution as raw milk for human consumption.
> 
> QUESTION 3: Have any symptomatic cattle been identified so far at Raw Farm's premises
> 
> RESPONSE: As previously noted, please contact the California Department of Food and Agriculture for this question.
