> Question [00:02:17]
> 
> Do you have any big ticket items that you're trying to accomplish in the month and a half left that you have the FDA?
> 
> Robert Califf [00:02:23]
> 
> Well, some of them were here, front of package and healthy. The nicotine standard is another big one that's in play right now. You'll hear more about that.
> 
> And, this sounds kind of, so what, but we have many, many guidances that the industry is dependent on that need to get through the system.
> 
> Not because any one of them is-- but they're just making it possible for industry to do its work in a way that's safer and more effective.
> 
> So I wouldn't pick one of those specifically, a good example would be the issue of hair straightner and formaldehyde. It's a pretty basic thing.
> 
> So just needs to get done.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf [00:00:30]
> 
> It's very difficult to give a specific amount of money because the work needs to be adjusted for the specific purpose that Congress wants us to do, but in the area of chemical safety, it would at least take a doubling of the budget to just really begin to address the numerous chemicals that derived food and make sure that they're safe.
> 
> And when it comes to nutrition, we have a very meager budget for nutrition. Yet, as we discussed today, this is harming a lot of people, the food that they're eating. So it would a large amount if we really want to address nutrition.

## Ohio health department statement on pertussis

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Ohio Department of Health spokesperson
- **Date:** received December 5, 2024

> Pertussis can be cyclical. After seeing lower numbers of reported cases in the past few years -- during and after the COVID-19 pandemic -- nationally, pertussis is now returning to pre-pandemic trends.
> 
> Ohio is no different. So far this year, Ohio has seen over 1,200 cases. This is higher than we saw last year and is consistent with some years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
> 
> Between 2010 and 2014, for example, Ohio reported an average of 1,285 cases annually, including over 1,600 cases in 2013.
> 
> State data on pertussis and more than 100 other infectious diseases can be found on our dashboard, Summary of Infectious Diseases in Ohio.
> 
> You can sort the timeframe, specific disease, county and demographic profile. To find pertussis, under “Reportable Condition” unclick “all,” select pertussis from the dropdown menu, then click “Apply.”
> 
> We would recommend going back and selecting a longer timeframe, perhaps even back to 2001, the earliest data we have available, to see the longer-term trends for pertussis cases. Click on “epi curve” after you have selected a timeframe to see this.
> 
> The Ohio Department of Health (ODH) has been working with local health departments by providing guidance and support on responding to individual cases and outbreaks of pertussis.
> 
> ODH encourages individuals to stay up to date on vaccines to help prevent pertussis, which can be especially dangerous to infants. Additionally, everyone should stay home when they are sick, cover any coughs or sneezes, and wash their hands frequently.

## California health department statement on Raw Farm recall

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** California Department of Public Health spokesperson
- **Date:** received December 4, 2024

> QUESTION 1: Will CDPH test either of the positive samples to see if they are infectious? Or is it known if either are infectious? 
> 
> California has secured a broad, voluntary recall of all Raw Farm, LLC raw milk and cream products due to possible bird flu contamination. While no human bird flu cases associated with the product have been detected at this time, health experts have long warned consumers against consuming raw milk or raw milk products due to elevated risks of foodborne illness, including Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, toxin producing E. coli, Brucella, Campylobacter, and others. Raw milk products are not pasteurized, a heating process that kills bacteria and viruses such as bird flu.  
> 
> No human bird flu cases associated with the product have been confirmed to date, and the state is working closely with federal and local partners to investigate the situation and better understand how it might impact consumers. Bird flu virus levels have been demonstrated to be high in raw milk from infected cows, and sporadic human cases identified in workers in close contact with infected dairy cows and their milk indicate that raw milk is infectious to humans. 
> 
> QUESTION 2: Is it known if any of Raw Farm's products were sold outside of California?  
> 
> Federal law does not allow interstate sales of raw milk for human consumption, so the recalled product was only sold within California.  
> 
> It is possible that raw milk intended for pet consumption was sold to customers outside California. Interstate sales of raw milk for pets is legal, as long as vendors abide by the FDA pet food labeling requirements (21CFR Part 501), Raw milk for pets should be handled with the same caution as raw milk for human consumption.
> 
> QUESTION 3: Have any symptomatic cattle been identified so far at Raw Farm's premises
> 
> RESPONSE: As previously noted, please contact the California Department of Food and Agriculture for this question.
