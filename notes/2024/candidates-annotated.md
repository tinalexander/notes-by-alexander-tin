> Donald Trump [16;05]
>

> 
> ...
> 
> Donald Trump [16;44]
> 
> She wants to give free health care for millions of illegal aliens and give them all citizenship into the United States immediately.

> 
> Donald Trump [40;04] 
> 
> Kamala Harris can't answer how she'd pay for any of her new, radicalized, liberal spending schemes that will bankrupt our country and do it quickly, destroy Social Security, destroy Medicare.
> 
> ...
> 
> Donald Trump [40;54]
> 
> No clue how she'd pay for free health care for illegals. She wants to give free health care to illegals. 
> 
> Now you want to stop people from coming into our country, the first thing you do, and you would have to do this immediately, no health care. We can't do that. We can't afford it. It's not sustainable.
> 
> But they're doing just the opposite. Come to America. Live the American dream.
> 
> We'll give your children free schooling, we'll give you free health care, we'll give you pensions, we'll put you into Social Security.

> Joe Biden [27;39] 
> 
> More Americans have peace of mind that comes from having health insurance. 
> 
> More Americans have health insurance today than ever before in American history.
> 
> And after, as a young senator beginning to fight, we got in a fight for 50 years to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, we finally beat big pharma.
> 
> And guess who cast the tie breaking vote? 
> 
> Vice president, soon to be president, Kamala Harris. And now it's the law of land. 
> 
> Instead of paying 400 dollars a month for insulin, seniors with diabetes will pay 35 a month. 
> 
> The law we passed, already includes, starting in January, every senior's total prescription cost can be capped at 2,000 dollars, no matter how expensive the drugs they have.
> 
> And what we don’t focus on, and our Republican friends doesn't seem to understand, our reforms don't just save seniors money, they save the American taxpayers money.  
> 
> You know what we just passed saved? It saved 160 billion dollars over the next decade.
> 
> That’s not hyperbole. It’s because Medicare no longer has to pay those exorbitant prices to the big pharma.  
> 
> ...
> 
> Joe Biden [54;27] 
> 
> They'll keep taking on big pharma, making insulin 35 dollars a month, not just for seniors, but for everyone in America. 
> 
> And capping prescription drug costs at a total of 2,000 dollars, not just for seniors, but for everyone. 
> 
> And folks, that's going to save America, again, tens of billions of dollars.
> 
> ...
> 
> Joe Biden [57;08]
> 
> They'll protect Social Security and Medicare. 
> 
> Trump wants to cut Social Security and Medicare.
> 
> ...
> 
> Joe Biden [57;25]
> 
> And you know Trump will do everything he can to ban abortion nationwide. Oh he will. 
> 
> You know, Kamala and Tim will do everything they possibly can, that's why have to elect the Senate and the House, to restore Roe v. Wade.
