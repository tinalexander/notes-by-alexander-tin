> 
> ...
> 
> Donald Trump [16;44]

> Donald Trump [40;54]
> 
> No clue how she'd pay for free health care for illegals. She wants to give free health care to illegals. 
> 
> Now you want to stop people from coming into our country, the first thing you do, and you would have to do this immediately, no health care. We can't do that. We can't afford it. It's not sustainable.
> 
> But they're doing just the opposite. Come to America. Live the American dream.
> 
> We'll give your children free schooling, we'll give you free health care, we'll give you pensions, we'll put you into Social Security.

> Joe Biden [27;39] 
> 
> More Americans have peace of mind that comes from having health insurance. 
> 
> More Americans have health insurance today than ever before in American history.
> 
> And after, as a young senator beginning to fight, we got in a fight for 50 years to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, we finally beat big pharma.
> 
> And guess who cast the tie breaking vote? 
> 
> Vice president, soon to be president, Kamala Harris. And now it's the law of land. 
> 
> Instead of paying 400 dollars a month for insulin, seniors with diabetes will pay 35 a month. 
> 
> The law we passed, already includes, starting in January, every senior's total prescription cost can be capped at 2,000 dollars, no matter how expensive the drugs they have.
> 
> And what we don’t focus on, and our Republican friends doesn't seem to understand, our reforms don't just save seniors money, they save the American taxpayers money.  
> 
> You know what we just passed saved? It saved 160 billion dollars over the next decade.

> 
> ...
> 
> Joe Biden [54;27] 
> 
> They'll keep taking on big pharma, making insulin 35 dollars a month, not just for seniors, but for everyone in America. 
> 
> And capping prescription drug costs at a total of 2,000 dollars, not just for seniors, but for everyone. 
> 
> And folks, that's going to save America, again, tens of billions of dollars.
> 
> ...
> 
> Joe Biden [57;08]

> They'll protect Social Security and Medicare. 
> 
> Trump wants to cut Social Security and Medicare.
> 
> ...
> 
> Joe Biden [57;25]
> 
> And you know Trump will do everything he can to ban abortion nationwide. Oh he will. 
>

> ...

> Kamala Harris [26;02]

> 
> As attorney general, I took on insurance companies and big pharma and got them to lower their prices.
>

> 
> We capped the price of insulin at 35 dollars a month and the total cost-- And the total cost of prescription drugs at 2,000 a year for seniors.
> 
> We let Medicare negotiate lower drug prices for seniors.
> 
> And just yesterday-- and just yesterday, we announced that we are lowering the price by up to 80% for 10 more life saving drugs.
> 
> And I pledge to continue this progress. 
> 
> I'll lower the cost of insulin and prescription drugs for everyone, with your support, not only our seniors, and demand transparency from the middlemen companies who use opaque practices to raise your drug prices and profit off your need for medicine.
> 
> Two months ago I announced that medical debt will no longer be used against your credit score. 
> 
> And I will work, as president, with states like here in North Carolina, Roy Cooper, thank you again, to cancel medical debt for more and more, millions more Americans.
> 
> As for Donald Trump, well he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which 45 million Americans rely on.
> 
> 45 million Americans rely on it for health care. That would take us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. 
> 
> We all remember what that was. And we're not going back. We're not going back.
> 
> And remember-- and this is why we're not going back, because we do remember, he tried to cut Medicare every year he was president, threatening a program that tens of millions of seniors count on.
> 
> And according to his Project 2025 agenda, he intends to undo our work to bring down prescription drugs, the cost of prescription drugs, and insulin costs.

> ...

> 
> Think about that. To take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions.
> 
> You remember what that was, like children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes. 
> 
> Look, America has tried these failed policies before and we are not going back. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kamala Harris [45;19]
> 
> We all know how we got here.
>

> 
> And as he intended they did. Now in more than 20 states, there is a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest.
> 
> And be sure, if he were to win, he would sign a national abortion ban, which would outlaw abortion in every state, even Nevada.
> 
> But we are not going to let that happen. Because we trust women.
> 
> And when I am president, and Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms, I will sign it into law.
