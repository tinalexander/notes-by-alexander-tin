> 
> More Americans have peace of mind that comes from having health insurance. 
> 
> More Americans have health insurance today than ever before in American history.
> 
> And after, as a young senator beginning to fight, we got in a fight for 50 years to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, we finally beat big pharma.

> And guess who cast the tie breaking vote? 
> 
> Vice president, soon to be president, Kamala Harris. And now it's the law of land. 
> 
> Instead of paying 400 dollars a month for insulin, seniors with diabetes will pay 35 a month. 
> 
> The law we passed, already includes, starting in January, every senior's total prescription cost can be capped at 2,000 dollars, no matter how expensive the drugs they have.
> 
> And what we don’t focus on, and our Republican friends doesn't seem to understand, our reforms don't just save seniors money, they save the American taxpayers money.  
> 
> You know what we just passed saved? It saved 160 billion dollars over the next decade.
> 
> That’s not hyperbole. It’s because Medicare no longer has to pay those exorbitant prices to the big pharma.  
> 
> ...

> 
> Joe Biden [57;25]
> 
> And you know Trump will do everything he can to ban abortion nationwide. Oh he will.
