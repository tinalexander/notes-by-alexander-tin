This [repository](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes/tree/main) contains [files](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes-by-alexander-tin/tree/main/attachments) and other notes gathered by me (Alexander Tin) while covering the Biden administration's public health agencies, including their response to infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19 or mpox. Some of these end up in articles and other reporting I do for the network.

Before December 2022, many of my notes were previously written in Revue before being shared on Twitter. Revue has since been shut down, but you can still see some of those notes on the Internet Archive. 

Previously I was organizing them under Github's [Wiki tab](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes/wiki/About-these-notes), but I moved them to publish here with Github Pages in hopes of making them [indexable by search engines](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis#:~:text=Note%3A%20Search,a%20public%20repository.).

You can learn more about me [here](https://github.com/tinalexander), including my contact information.
