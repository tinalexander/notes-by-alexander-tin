This [repository](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes/tree/main) contains [files](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes-by-alexander-tin/tree/main/attachments) and other notes gathered by Alexander Tin while covering the Biden administration's public health agencies, including their response to infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19 or mpox.

Previously they were organized under [the Wiki tab](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes/wiki/About-these-notes), but I moved them to Github Pages in hopes of making them [indexable by search engines](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis#:~:text=Note%3A%20Search,a%20public%20repository.).

You can learn about me [here](https://github.com/tinalexander), including my contact information.
