This [repository](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes/tree/main) contains files and notes gathered by [Alexander Tin](https://github.com/tinalexander) while covering the Biden administration's public health agencies, including their response to infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19 or mpox.

I've moved the notes that were in this repository over to [the Wiki tab](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes/wiki/About-these-notes).
