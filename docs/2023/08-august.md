### From a CDC spokesperson regarding the departure of Jose Romero from CDC

Dr. Romero has had one of the toughest jobs at CDC, leading the center responsible for fighting respiratory diseases through a critical period for all of public health – as we transitioned out of the national COVID-19 public health emergency. His service to the agency and our country is deeply appreciated. We are pleased that Dr. Demetre Daskalakis will serve as acting director for our National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). Most recently, Dr. Daskalakis served as the Deputy Coordinator of the White House’s Mpox Response, helping to lead the vaccination and public education efforts that halted the advance of last year’s mpox outbreak. He is a nationally recognized public health leader, and we are excited for him to lead NCIRD as we head into the winter respiratory virus season. 

### From a "Media briefing on global health issues" [press conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYBfozLCEM4&t=1s) hosted by WHO

Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO [00:40:11]

The Technical Advisory Group for Virus Evolution meets regularly to assess this and other variants and the Technical Advisory Group for COVID 19 Vaccine Composition, TAG CO VAC, as you mentioned, also meets regularly. 

They will meet again to look at, exactly as you say, what, how are the vaccines performing against the circulating variants? It depends on the studies that are underway and those studies take time. 

So it's a constant iterative exchange of information from researchers, from member states, and those who are producing the vaccines themselves. We can't predict what TAG CO VAC will recommend in the future. They have to be agile to look at the available data as we go forward, but that is something TAG CO VAC will do regularly to decide whether or not an update to vaccine composition is warranted. And we're grateful for all of our advisors who are working on that.

...

Sylvie Briand, WHO [00:41:13]

I think the issue of deciding the composition of the vaccine is quite difficult with this virus, which is constantly evolving. And as Maria mentioned, because there is no currently predominant variant anywhere, but a number of co circulating variants, decisions on vaccine composition remains challenging. 

But, I think the TAG CO VAC has decided as a strategy to really look to increase the breadth of immunity. And so when we do the virus antigenic mapping, we look at all the viruses that are circulating, and all the variants that are circulating, and we try to select the antigen that will provide this maximum breadth of immunity so that the protection to people is as wide as possible, anticipating that the virus may evolve between the time where the recommendation is issued and the time when the vaccine is produced. 

So, really is a strategy to minimize the risk and maximize the protection to people and always ensure that we have the best vaccine possible. 

### From an [episode](https://omny.fm/shows/in-the-bubble/the-new-cdc-director-on-the-covid-wave-w-dr-mandy) of "In the Bubble with Andy Slavitt"

Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:18:40]

While we are not finalized on all the approvals yet, so FDA still needs to do its final work with the manufacturers, as well as the CDC do its final job to make sure we are making full recommendations on who should get those COVID shots. 

What I would say is that we anticipate that they are going to be available for most folks by the third or fourth week of September. So in the near term, so there's work being done now, we think by the end of September, they'll be available, but there's some work to do. And again, we got to make sure we hit all of the right marks for it to be available. 

What we are anticipating right now, as we look at the data and we see how the virus is changing, we see how immunity changes over the course of the year, similar to flu shots, right? Which we get every year annually. We are likely to see this be-- and again, I don't want to get ahead of the scientists and that are going to do their work in the next few weeks, but we are likely to see this as a recommendation as an annual COVID shot, just like we have an annual flu shot. 

And I think that will give more folks clarity about, should they get one or not? Because the answer is like, well, did you get one this year, if not go get the new COVID shot, assuming all of that-- again, we're waiting for the FDA to do its work. We're waiting for CDC's experts to do its work in terms of recommendations, but likely where we are headed, so folks can start to think about it, is that this will be an annual vaccine, and again, to make sure that you stay protected.

...

Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:44:08]

You may have heard that there were a few cases this year of domestically acquired malaria. They were the first nine cases that we'd seen in 20 years. So we haven't seen domestic malaria in 20 years. This year, we saw nine cases, seven of them in Florida, two in Texas. And I was so impressed with the team here at the CDC that really jumped on this issue. 

Now CDC deals with malaria in other countries. That's again, where we are working abroad to prevent a threat from coming here. And so all the work we do in other countries to prevent malaria is why we don't have malaria here. We need to continue that work abroad, but we have that expertise because we work abroad, we brought it to bear here in Florida, and Texas, so to support the state in everything that they were doing. And they, they did very good work here. 

And, but we were able to offer support to the clinicians in the area to make sure they could identify malaria. Malaria is not common, which is a good thing here, but we need to then help clinicians know how to identify and test. We were able to offer lab capacity and testing. There is treat, we made sure treatment was going to be available. And again, we have tools that we can can utilize. We know how to get rid of the mosquitoes that transmit malaria. 

So we brought all those tools to bear, and now we're not out of the window yet, but the good news is, is it's been four to five weeks now, and we have not seen another case.

### From a Texas DSHS spokesperson regarding COVID-19 increase

So far, we have not noted any significant age group disparities that are unique about this most recent COVID-19 increase. Both adults and children who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 are at elevated risk of severe COVID-19 disease relative to those who have received vaccinations. We will continue monitoring Texas COVID-19 hospitalization trends.

For context, CDC’s reporting of Emergency Department (ED) patient visits with diagnosed COVID-19 data is based on a different data source than we use for COVID-19 hospitalization data monitoring:

CDC’s ED visits data source is from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP): [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#ed-visits_all_ages_combined](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/*ed-visits_all_ages_combined__;Iw!!CxwJSw!J3aTquwTQZproeF3jBvz7SBklR32jQugyEBr-2HYqIwT8C24_XJPhF3NdSJekPN1zoaO5unx3jSRO5M__5ItrvDJlbcd7Q$)
Texas DSHS monitors hospitalizations data reported daily from facilities to DSHS. Based on this data source, as of 8/5/2023, the number of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Texas (all ages) was 860. Hospitalizations in Texas for COVID-19 (all ages) are on an increasing trend.
These data sources vary in both the method of data collection and specific data collected. Both are provisional and subject to change.

### From an FDA spokesperson regarding timing of updated COVID vaccines

While we cannot comment directly on timing, the FDA anticipates taking timely action to authorize or approve updated COVID-19 vaccines in order to make vaccines available this fall that meet our expectations for safety, effectiveness and quality.

### From a "Novavax Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results" [webcast](https://ir.novavax.com/events/novavax-second-quarter-2023-financial-results)

John Trizzino, Novavax [00:17:02]

The U.S., as planned, is exiting the pandemic phase and entering a more traditional seasonal vaccine market with many similarities to seasonal annual influenza vaccine distribution. 

We have been preparing for commercialization in the U.S. throughout the pandemic phase, and we are ready organization wide for availability of product as soon as September, of course, dependent on our FDA strain specific authorization, and ACIP recommendations for use.

As you would expect, there has been significant collaboration across many U.S. agencies, and within HHS to ensure that this transition is executed smoothly and there is vaccine available for anyone interested in receiving a COVID vaccine.

...

John Trizzino, Novavax [00:18:28]

Our updated XBB COVID vaccine is on track to be in our U.S. facility in September and immediately available for distribution and use upon authorization. 

...

John Trizzino, Novavax [00:21:01]

A core focus for us is manufacturing readiness. We have been manufacturing our updated XBB COVID vaccine at commercial scale, which will enable us to supply tens of millions of doses of our vaccine, in line with our planned demand for the fall season. 

We expect to have doses in our U.S. warehouse in advance of FDA's authorization and ACIP's policy recommendations to ensure that we can quickly ship initial stocking orders to customers in September. 

...

John Trizzino, Novavax [00:29:30]

In the U.S., we have initiated the rolling submission of our BLA filing, and we intend to submit the remainder of our data over the coming months. 

While full approval via the BLA process will be an important milestone for us early next year, we will be able to sell and market our updated XBB COVID vaccine for the upcoming 2023 fall vaccination season under emergency use authorization. 

...

Filip Dubovsky, Novavax [00:57:04]

We've submitted the preclinical and clinical packages, and we're going to complete that file this month. 

We previously discussed with the FDA the need for what kind of clinical data we need. And that's why we conducted the study. The XBB.1.5 data is adequate, not only for the U.S., but globally for approval for the XBB.1.5. 

And our plan is to have the product available in time for the FDA, CDC release at the end of September. 

...

Filip Dubovsky, Novavax [01:18:32]

The BLA itself is based on the prototype vaccine, 2373, the original strain. So that, as John said is, we have a rolling submission and that's going in now.

The approval for EUA, for the XBB, is also going in, as I've said, we've completed a complete clinical roll. And the data I showed you today is the key clinical data for authorization of the XBB variant. There's no other data in that file other than the data you saw today. 

And that's going to be concluded this month, with expectation for us to be delivering product by the end of September for the CDC, FDA. 

Now there's a subsequent supplemental BLA next year, which will wrap all this up into a single file going forward. So at some point next year, we're going to be out of the EUA game and in a straight BLA game with this and all subsequent variants. 

### From a CDC spokesperson on timing of COVID-19 vaccines

Manufacturers are currently updating COVID-19 vaccines for the fall. These vaccines will be updated with the goal of providing the best protection against currently circulating strains. The FDA anticipates taking timely action to authorize or approve updated COVID-19 vaccines in order to make vaccines available this fall. After their authorization or approval, ACIP will meet to make a recommendation outlining use of these updated vaccines this fall.

### From an NIH statement on long COVID smell loss treatment trials

This response can be attributed to NIH: _Patients experience many symptoms, the interventions currently tested or in process of being tested may sort effects on many of these symptoms, including loss of smell/taste._

## August 4, 2023

### From a CDC spokesperson regarding the lack of Nowcast estimates for some regions

Because Nowcast is modeled data, we need a certain number of sequences to accurately predict proportions in the present.  For some regions, we have limited numbers of sequences available, and therefore are not displaying nowcast estimates in those regions, though those regions are still being used in the aggregated national nowcast. All regions are still displayed for the weighted estimates which are not models but from sequences.

## August 3, 2023

### From a "Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance - Second Quarter 2023" [webcast](https://investors.pfizer.com/Investors/Events--Presentations/event-details/2023/Pfizer-Quarterly-Corporate-Performance--Second-Quarter-2023-2023-TldwVR3dis/default.aspx)

Albert Bourla, Pfizer [00:23:24]

The uncertainty of the exact timing of Comirnaty commercialization was largely removed with the decision by the FDA and CDC to request a change in the composition of the vaccine to address the Omicron XBB.1.5 strains. 

We believe this will allow us to commercialize the vaccine in September, assuming the updated vaccines are approved and available by the end of August, of course.

...

Albert Bourla, Pfizer [01:39:10]

So the vaccinations, with a new, will start in September, hopefully of course. What we expect is that we will have approval by the end of the of the August, and we are ready with product already now. So we have-- so production will not be an issue. 

...

Albert Bourla, Pfizer [01:17:42]

We are very excited about the combinations, right, and the combinations will be flu and COVID, and then hopefully also flu, COVID, and RSV, and we are working on that. And we believe actually that the fact that,  if we have a combination with the non RNA included, there will have likely that we expect to have the benefit of better safety profile, because you don't have to load three products RNA into the single injection, but we will be using only two, COVID and flu. And then we'll use a protein based vaccine, which is very (inaudible) for RSV, all of that are working very well. 

### From a "Moderna 2Q 2023 Earnings Call" [webcast](https://investors.modernatx.com/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2023/Moderna-2Q-2023-Earnings-Call-2023-iJlEMU83tt/default.aspx)

Jamey Mock, Moderna [02:07:01]

As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, most of this cost is fixed at this point. We've already ordered the raw materials, we've already started manufacturing, most of our-- we've got a lot of supply ready to go as soon as we are able to-- as soon as we got regulatory approval.

So that three and a half to four billion dollars is not really dependent too much on the sales outcome. That'll happen either way. 

...

Arpa Garay, Moderna [01:37:07]

As I mentioned earlier, a key determinant for the market size in the U.S. will be vaccine uptake, or shots in arms, during the upcoming September to December timeframe. As I've mentioned before, our expected 2023 sales range of six to eight billion dollars will be primarily driven by vaccination rates in the U.S. market. 

...

Stephen Hoge, Moderna [00:48:05]

So as you know, we've had-- as I said, we have six combo vaccines. We have lots of clinical data out there, and we continue to look at new combinations. And if we're in a situation that we expect to be in, where we have a flu, RSV, and COVID approved, as well as the second generation COVID moving forward, you can be-- you can rest assured we'll be looking at multiple different combinations of those, trying to bring forward options that provide the greatest public health flexibility.

Those studies, once we have the products approved, the monovalent vaccines, those studies are really just immune bridging studies, demonstrating that we can do the combination and achieve non-inferior immunogenicity, and safety in those studies, they can be quite quick, and they also don't need to be run in the season, as you know, and so our goal is going to be, as we've said throughout this year, is to complete the work to move towards approval, filing, and eventually hopefully approval of the three monovalent vaccines, and quickly progressing into the pivotal phase threes for at least one and multiple combos. 

Our goal, again, is to be launching those in '25 and beyond for the obvious reason that they will improve compliance, deliver more value, and actually decrease the administration cost of healthcare. So, the path is actually pretty pretty clear from here, particularly given the strength of the RSV data, and where we are in COVID, and we hope to be providing an update very shortly on flu that also provides a clear path for '24 in the monovalent launches we've guided, and then I think we'll clarify very quickly that we're starting the phase threes to allow the combo launches very shortly thereafter.

### From the CDC's "August 2023 ZOHU Call" [webinar](https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/zohu/2023/august.html)

Tim Uyeki, CDC [00:33:30]

Since early 2022, we have had 50 states or territories that have identified high-path H5N1 viruses in wild birds. And so most of this was in 2022. Some of it has occurred in 2023, but it's certainly in every state except for Hawaii, as far as I know. Next slide. 

In terms of poultry outbreaks, we had a lot of poultry outbreaks last year, both in commercial flocks, but also backyard flocks. What you see on the bottom left there is 47 states have reported outbreaks, either in commercial or backyard flocks since the beginning of 2022.

But the figure in the lower right is more recent. You can see just in the last 30 days very limited detections and no poultry outbreaks have occurred for several months or at least been identified. So the impact was much greater in the U.S. last year and continued on into early this year. Almost 59 million birds have either died or been culled, depopulated, to control these outbreaks. 

...

Tim Uyeki, CDC [00:38:04]

Seasonal influenza A viruses circulating among people binding primarily to alpha2-6-linked sialic acid receptors that are found primarily in the human upper respiratory tract, whereas avian influenza A viruses tend to bind to receptors bearing alpha2-3-linked sialic acid receptors. We call those avian like, and those are present in both the respiratory as well as the gastrointestinal track of birds. So they're present in respiratory as well as gastrointestinal secretions, feces. 

And so, it's not completely the case that only alpha2-6-linked sialic acid receptors are in the human upper respiratory tract, but we believe that in order to really increase the risk to public health, these viruses, or any avian viruses, would need to be able to bind more efficiently to alpha2-6-linked sialic acid receptors in the upper respiratory tract of people. 

And we haven't seen that to date.

...

Tim Uyeki, CDC [00:50:28]

This year there have been four other cases reported from the U.K. in poultry workers, responding to confirmed H5N1 poultry outbreaks, all asymptomatic, low viral levels, viral RNA levels. 

It's a bit unclear whether those represent true infection or not. My suspicion is the bulk of those asymptomatic cases are attributable to transient detection of viral RNA at low levels and not true infection. I can't prove that though, but I'm doubtful that those asymptomatic cases, or the U.S. case last year, actually represented true infection, yet met criteria for reporting to WHO under the international health regulations. And I think that was very appropriate to report all those cases. 

I'll say that there are cases of true asymptomatic H5N1 infection that I am aware of, that have been confirmed both virologically and serologically. I think convincing evidence that asymptomatic virus infection can occur. And because these viruses continue to evolve, we do want to know whether or not there's an increase in asymptomatic infections or mild cases. 

...

Question [00:58:58]

Does decrease in bird detections of H5N1, recently, portend a coming end to the current outbreak in the U.S.?

Tim Uyeki, CDC [00:59:06]

I don't think we know. It's a great question. 

But because it's wild birds spreading this virus around, and particularly migratory birds, I don't think we know. And so I think let's see what happens as birds come south from Canada later this late summer into the early fall. 

And whether this becomes endemic in wild birds in the U.S., it's a bit unclear. Some people think it is. I think it's not quite clear yet.

But if it does become endemic in wild birds, then I think then poultry outbreaks will continue to occur, at least there will be that potential.

### From a Sanofi spokesperson regarding Beyfortus

·       The recommendation from ACIP to include Beyfortus in the CDC’s Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule means the cost of Beyfortus will be covered without a co-pay, in accordance with the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  

·       In addition, the ACIP vote to place Beyfortus on the Vaccines for Children program ensures equitable access for babies whose parents or guardians may not be able to afford immunizations. Beyfortus would be provided at no cost to American Indian or Alaska Native infants, as well as infants who are uninsured, underinsured, or Medicaid-ineligible. 

·       It is important to note that there may be costs related to copays for physician office visits that can vary depending on insurance coverage. Individuals, or their healthcare providers, should contact their health insurance plan to determine coverage and reimbursement requirements as well as adoption timeframes. 

### From a CDC ACIP meeting on August 3 about nirsevimab

Melinda Wharton, CDC [11:04:37]

By way of introduction to the topic of today's meeting, I'd briefly like to go over two different processes for immunization, passive and active. 

With passive immunization, the person receiving the protection is administered pre-formed antibody that comes from somewhere else. Diphtheria antitoxin is still manufactured in horses, but most products for passive immunization come from human immune globulin. And now, some antibody products are made in cell culture systems. 

These antibodies can provide excellent protection, but that protection wanes over time, because the antibodies that are given only last so long. Transfer of maternal antibody across the placenta that provides protection in early infancy is another example of passive immunization. 

In contrast, active immunization that we see with traditional vaccines come from the response of the recipients own immune system. Thanks to immunological memory, protection is longer than we see with passive immunization, and can be lifelong. 

Thanks to advances in biotechnology, we now have the opportunity to prevent infectious diseases with long-acting monoclonal antibodies. When used for passive immunization, these products can provide a level of protection similar to see to that we see with traditional vaccine, but for a limited period of time. 

They can be especially valuable when full protection is needed without delay, and when a traditional vaccine is not available. And for some indications, the protection provided by a long-acting monoclonal might be long enough to provide protection during the risk period with a single dose. 

For example, for the duration of a respiratory disease season, for a critical part of a pregnancy, or for the duration of travel.

...

Melinda Wharton, CDC [11:06:25]

CDC will prioritize for ACIP consideration those long-acting monoclonal antibodies for prevention of infectious diseases that are expected to address conditions that result in a significant burden of disease to the public's health, are not expected, based on the characteristics of the product itself, to present significant implementation issues for immunization providers. 

I will say, as in that there's a large number of implementation issues that arise with monoclonal antibodies, as you'll be hearing later in this meeting, but it's not due to the characteristics of the product itself, it's due to other factors and are expected to be priced at a level allowing for incorporation into immunization programs. 

...

John Farley, FDA [11:11:31]

FDA imposed two postmarketing requirements, one focused on monitoring the prevalence of RSV variants, including the frequency of known nirsevimab resistance associated substitutions, and the second requirement to phenotypically assess certain RSV A and RSV B substitutions. 

Sponsor has agreed to a number of post-marketing commitments. Among these, they include conducting the HARMONY study extension, which will evaluate antibody dependent enhancement of RSV disease, as well as conducting an observational U.S. based long-term study of infants eligible to receive nirsevimab in their first year of life, to assess the impact of RSV disease through day 511 post-dosing. 

...

John Farley, FDA [11:12:22]

The FDA has determined that a pharmacovigilance strategy is necessary to support coordinated monitoring and assessment of safety information from data sources across both FDA and CDC. ACIP recommendations will be factored into the final pharmacovigilance strategy, as appropriate. 

The full details of this strategy will be finalized in a separate document within 90 days of marketing approval. And this pharmacovigilance strategy may be modified as safety information accumulates during the postmarketing period. 

...

Sarah Long, ACIP [11:23:50]

And should there be an RSV maternal vaccine that becomes licensed, we will discuss that, and we'll discuss it in light of what happens with today's vote on nirsevimab. But today the sole focus is nirsevimab. Next slide, please.

...

Jefferson Jones, CDC [11:30:16]

As previously presented, this figure shows data from the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System or NREVSS, which is our primary source for monitoring RSV seasonality in the United States. Displayed is the percent of RSV PCR results that are positive from participating laboratories as shown in blue, for the 2017 to 2020 seasons, before the COVID 19 pandemic RSV transmission followed a consistent seasonal pattern with peaks during December to February. 

During 2020 to 21, shown in the orange hash line, there was very limited RSV circulation until late spring of 2021, and then activity peaked in late summer of 2021, shown in the yellow line and transmission continued throughout the fall into December 2021. The most recent RSV season is shown in red, with increasing RSV activity starting in late summer 2022, and RSV transmission peaked in October to November 2022. 

So to summarize, the 2022 to 23 season began later than the 21 to 22 season, but earlier than pre pandemic seasons, and this suggests an incremental reversion to pre pandemic seasonality with winter peaks. And I'm reviewing these data to highlight the uncertainty in when the next RSV season will start. 

...

Jefferson Jones, CDC [11:31:42]

RSV is the most common cause of hospitalization in U.S. infants. The highest RSV hospitalization rates are in the first months life, and the risk declines by month with increasing age in infancy and early childhood. 

Prematurity and other chronic diseases increase risk of RSV associated hospitalization, but most hospitalizations are in healthy term infants. 

...

Jefferson Jones, CDC [11:37:35]

In a survey of people currently pregnant or pregnant within the last 12 months, conducted by the University of Iowa and the Rand Corporation, on RSV immunizations with CDC, only 33% of respondents thought their baby definitely or probably would get an RSV infection within one year after being born.

Despite being unsure or perceiving RSV risk to be low, respondents were worried their baby would be need to be hospitalized if they got sick with RSV, with a mean response, four out five, with five being most worried. And 70% of respondents said they definitely or probably would get an RSV antibody injection for their baby, if safe and effective. 

...

Jefferson Jones, CDC [11:40:25]

I will highlight updates made to the cost effectiveness analysis presented in February. The company has provided an updated estimate cost of product. The list price was estimated to be $495. And the cost for the Vaccines for Children program was estimated to be $395. 

Assuming nirsevimab is administered as 50% under VFC, and 50% are private insurance, the average price was $445, and this price is not final at this time, per our understanding.

...

Jefferson Jones, CDC [11:42:16]

The updated base case result of the cost effectiveness analysis is $102,811 per quality adjusted life year saved. The work group felt nirsevimab is or probably is a reasonable and efficient use of resources and a full presentation for this updated cost effectiveness analysis is available in the extra slides. 

...

Jefferson Jones, CDC [11:55:57]

The work group felt that nirsevimab use among children aged eight through 19 months, entering their second RSV season, who are at an increased risk of severe disease, is probably a reasonable and efficient allocation of resources. 

Like all domains, this is assuming increased risk of severe disease refers to groups recommended to receive palivizumab in their second RSV season by the American Academy of Pediatrics, and also including American Indian and Alaska Native children.

...

Georgina Peacock, CDC [11:58:34]

Suffice it to say, there are a lot of implementation considerations for nirsevimab, and I will walk through those. Some of them we have some mitigation strategies for right now and others we are exploring here at CDC and then with partners out in the field. And we look forward to working with people through these different considerations as we potentially implement this new product. 

...

Georgina Peacock, CDC [11:59:05]

One of the first issues that has been brought up is what the definition of vaccine is. And so when we look at the Vaccines for Children program, there is no statutory definition of vaccine in the statute. When we look at the Affordable Care Act, similarly, there is no statutory definition of vaccine, in the Affordable Care Act. 

So CDC has determined that nirsevimab is eligible for inclusion in the childhood immunization schedule, and the Vaccines for Children program. It's important to note, in this area, that some states do have different definitions of vaccine in their state statutes. And this may affect the state purchase of vaccine in places that are universal purchase states. However, it does not affect the use of federally purchased vaccine in states.

...

Georgina Peacock, CDC [12:00:06]

This is a, a costly product. However, as you heard before, there have been cost effectiveness studies to look at this. 

If nirsevimab is recommended by ACIP it will be covered by insurance and included in the VFC program. It's important to make sure that there is equitable access to nirsevimab. And so we understand that the cost of nirsevimab is a potential implementation barrier, particularly for outpatient settings or ambulatory practices. 

There is, in the provider agreement for VFC providers, a provision that if a practice has both public and private payers, that they do need to carry stock, so VFC stock and private stock, and we recognize that this may be challenging for some practices. We are working through some potential sort of short term solutions to this, as the ramp up of inclusion of nirsevimab in the VFC program would be occurring. And so those are some of the things that we're looking at to see, what might be able to be done during this introductory period. 

...

Georgina Peacock, CDC [12:01:39]

One of the things that is is helpful for this product is it does look similar to other routine vaccines. So it's administered intramuscularly with a single dose prefilled syringe. It can be administered simultaneously with other childhood vaccines. 

There is a weight based dosing to this, and then the storage and handling is similar to other routine vaccines. 

...

Georgina Peacock, CDC [12:02:13]

There have been some questions about scope of practice issues, and different jurisdictions or different states may have different scope of practice statutes related to who can administer injectable therapeutics versus vaccines. 

We did do a scan of different state statutes or laws to look at who is allowed to administer therapeutics and what we found that is in most states, it appears that medical assistants who frequently do administer vaccines will also be able to deliver injection drugs. 

There is some variability, but this appears to not be a huge issue related to scope of practice. 

...

Georgina Peacock, CDC [12:03:23]

So approximately 10% of birthing hospitals participate in the VFC program. There has been a suggestion that this is similar, if it were to be given in the hospital, this is similar to what we do with hepatitis B vaccine. What happens with hepatitis B vaccine is it is bundled into a payment model for newborn care. But it's important to note that hepatitis B vaccine costs approximately 13 to 16 dollars a dose. And so, it's anticipated that if this would be included in a bundled payment model, it may take some time for that to be put into practice. 

Additionally, in the hospital, there are of course needs and actually this, and I'll talk about it on the next slide as well. 

No matter where the dose is given, it's important that there be communication and documentation of all the parties involved. So if a dose were given in the hospital, making sure that the primary care provider is aware of that, there are some potential challenges about nirsevimab being entered into immunization information systems, given that it is a therapeutic versus a vaccine. And I'll discuss some of those issues a little bit later. 

And again, if there is eventually also a maternal RSV vaccine that is licensed and recommended, that also adds to this need for communication between maternal records, hospital records, and ambulatory settings or primary care offices.

...

Georgina Peacock, CDC [12:05:20]

Also recognize that an investment initial investment by pediatricians, who are unsure on the demand for the product, may create some challenges. And historically, there is a lag in insurance payment for new products. 

...

Georgina Peacock, CDC [12:05:40]

When we move into coding, again, because of the uniqueness of this product, there are some needs to look at the different coding requirements. So, the initial meeting, an AMA decision around CPT codes have classified nirsevimab as a drug or a therapeutic. That means that currently it is associated with an administration code that does not include a counseling component, and it's not eligible for a standalone counseling component. 

What I understand is there are some efforts underway to potentially propose a unique code for this product, that would include some of the counseling components to this, and then also the storage and handling components. And so those efforts are underway as a proposal. And again, there may be some potential challenges in recording the doses in IIS'es. 

...

Georgina Peacock, CDC [12:07:21]

I think suffice it to say the IT ecosystem is very complex. There are different partners working on this right now, and we are hopeful that we will be able to get these systems into place, so that this can happen in a timely manner. 

...

Georgina Peacock, CDC [12:07:55]

Because a Nici is coded as a therapeutic instead of a vaccine, it could create challenges with internal provider ordering with provision of a vaccine record, and some of the interoperability and data exchange with electronic health records and IIS'es

In addition to this, there are some forecasting issues. So related to the clinical decision support for immunizations, because the dosage is done by weight, and this-- the clinical decision support part of the IT system does not have access to the patient weight, that could create some challenges with forecasting doses. 

Second season recommendations also may be challenging. 

And finally, these clinical decision support systems are unable to take into an account of a maternal vaccination history for forecasting of an infant immunization. So that's not something that may be relevant right now, but it's something that we need to be thinking about. 

...

Georgina Peacock, CDC [12:10:54]

The question is what will the demand be as this is introduced as a new product? It's happening at the same time as commercialization of COVID 19 vaccine, and then of course we have seasonal influenza administration happening as well. 

So vaccine hesitancy is anticipated and therefore there is a need for counseling around all vaccines and products. And particularly as we introduce new products. 

...

Georgina Peacock, CDC [12:22:14]

Just wanted to give you a response on coverage related to the ACA. So nirsevimab will be covered under the ACA as a immunization with no copay, if it is recommended by ACIP. 

...

Jefferson Jones, CDC [12:35:54]

Providers should target administration in the first week of life, for infants born shortly before or during the RSV season, shortly before the start of the RSV season for infants aged less than eight months, and shortly before the start of the RSV season for children aged eight through 19 months, who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease. 

Now, while the optimal timing for nirsevimab administration is shortly before the season, nirsevimab may be given at any time during the RSV season for age eligible infants and children who have not yet received a dose. 

So based on pre pandemic patterns, this means nirsevimab could be administered in most of the continental United States from October through the end of March, and because the timing of the onset peak decline of RSV activity may vary by jurisdiction, providers can adjust administration schedules based on local epidemiology.

For infants born short shortly before or during the RSV season, nirsevimab should be administered within one week of birth administration can be during the birth hospitalization or in the outpatient setting, and infants with prolonged birth hospitalizations due to prematurity or other causes, they should receive nirsevimab shortly before or promptly after discharge.

Tropical climates may have seasonality that differs from most of the continental United States, or is unpredictable. And this may include southern Florida, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin islands in the U.S. affiliated Pacific Islands. Also in Alaska RSV, seasonality is less predictable and the duration of RSV seasons is often longer than the national average. Providers in these jurisdictions should consult state, local, or territorial guidance on the timing of nirsevimab administration.

...

Jefferson Jones, CDC [12:38:26]

The following groups of children aged eight through 19 months are recommended to receive nirsevimab when entering their second RSV season because of increased risk of severe disease: children with chronic lung disease of prematurity, who require medical support, this includes chronic corticosteroid therapy, diuretic therapy, or supplemental oxygen, and this is at any time during the six month period before the start of the second RSV season; children with severe immunocompromise; children with cystic fibrosis who have manifestations of severe lung disease, this includes previous hospitalization for pulmonary exacerbation in the first year of life or abnormalities on chest imaging that persist when stable; or weight for length that is less than the 10th percentile; and American Indian and Alaska Native children.

...

Jefferson Jones, CDC [12:41:41]

CDC will monitor report submitted to VAERS that involve simultaneous administration of nirsevimab with childhood vaccines, and will also monitor the safety of nirsevimab in the Vaccine Safety Datalink, or VSD. 

CDC will leverage existing vaccine effectiveness platforms. The New Vaccine Surveillance Network or NVSN is an active surveillance system for acute respiratory infection at seven pediatric medical centers that can assess effectiveness against outpatient and emergency department visits and hospitalizations. 

This platform can capture nirsevimab receipt through parent interviews, medical record reviews at the primary care provider and birth hospital, and through state immunization information systems or IIS. 

Virtual SARS-COV-2 Influenza or Other Respiratory Viruses Network, or VISION, is a multi-site electronic healthcare record based network that can assess effectiveness against emergency department and urgent care visits, hospitalization and critical illness. Nirsevimab effectiveness analyses will be limited to integrated healthcare systems sites that will have more complete capture of nirsevimab receipt, including through IIS linkage and claims data. 

CDC will monitor nirsevimab effectiveness throughout the season. The end of season estimates will likely be most accurate. The power to estimate effectiveness depends on nirsevimab uptake and RSV incidence. 

...

Jefferson Jones, CDC [12:43:44]

CDC is planning genomic surveillance of pediatric and adult RSV specimens, including whole genomic surveillance. This surveillance will monitor for changes in the F protein that might result in nirsevimab resistance.

...

Jefferson Jones, CDC [12:46:49]

The work group had a discussion and presentation on this. There is fairly limited data on nirsevimab being co-administered vaccines and immunogenicity. 

Per our discussions with expert input from our CDC immunologists, the risk appeared to be low, and both per the FDA label and per CDC's general best practices for immunization, we felt it appropriate to recommend co-administration of nirsevimab for age appropriate vaccines.

...

Natalie Thornburg, CDC [12:47:40]

Of course there's not a lot of data. There's not a lot of data with co-administration of monoclonal antibody prophylaxis with childhood immunization, just because they're not widely used yet. 

There is a little bit of data for infants who have received palivizumab and, there's no indication that they interfere with vaccine responses. Most of the data that's available for co-administration and-- co-administration of vaccines or inhibition of vaccines, deal with live attenuated vaccines, obviously in this product is not a vaccine, it is a passive immunization product. 

So the mechanisms of those inhibitions is not relevant to a passive product.

...

Jefferson Jones, CDC [12:52:23]

I want to emphasize that the trials showed a efficacy of 150 days. There is some data that suggests it may last longer than 150 days. So in those considerations of when to start here's the data, it shows neutralizing antibodies in blue were those that received nirsevimab who did and did not get a RSV in the and unfilled squares. And then you have the placebo groups in gray. Those filled in triangles are those who received-- had confirmed diagnostic confirmed RSV. 

So you see the neutralizing antibodies, even up to day 361, are higher in the nirsevimab group that both who did and did not get RSV than the placebo group who did get RSV. So, I think it's important to try and time it in our considerations when we talked about October through March, that it is shortly before the RSV season is the prime time. 

If you give it too early, and while you're in the peak of the RSV season, there is-- you still haven't given RSV, or RSV has the protection has substantially waned, would clearly be less than ideal, but given this, aiming for shortly before the RSV season, and then as soon as possible if that's not done.

...

Jefferson Jones, CDC [13:03:56]

We are working on, uh, education and other materials to help our providers that we can provide to them. And we'll be having future webinars, updated websites, hopefully in the near future.

...

Reed Grimes, HRSA [13:06:55]

For vaccines, the criteria for coverage is typically for, routinely administered vaccines, I should say it's through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. And that is when a vaccine has been recommended by CDC for routine administer administration to children or pregnant women, subject to an excise tax by federal law, and added to the vaccine injury table by the secretary of health of human services. 

So, the vaccine act that governs the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, does not clearly define, or does not define vaccine. So if all three of those criteria were met, there is a route for potential coverage in the VICP.

...

Jefferson Jones, CDC [13:14:17]

Should a maternal vaccine be licensed by FDA, we will visit that topic at that time.

...

Katherine Poehling, ACIP [13:14:32]

So does that mean we would have to meet and vote again? Thank you.

Jefferson Jones, CDC [13:14:38]

Yes, we would have to meet again to, to vote on a maternal vaccine and discuss any implications for nirsevimab.

...

Georgina Peacock, CDC [01:32:11]

I appreciate all of the comments and the recognition that that implementation is gonna be challenging. So I think one of the things we need to do is recognize that this is a new and very exciting product, that we are working through all of these things, and this is gonna be a transitionary season. 

And so, thinking that through, I think some of the things that you all have done here is bring up some of the really important issues related to insurance, related to coding.

I think also the issue around equity, you know, vaccines for children is really an example of a program that has very successfully addressed health equity issues. Over the last 30 years, it provides access to not only children that are on Medicaid, but also children that are under or uninsured, as well as Native American Alaska Native children. 

And so, all of these considerations are very important, and I do think that we're gonna need to work hand in hand with vaccine providers, with physicians, with nurses, with others that are involved in this, as well as our health departments to make sure that we continue to think about how are we going to provide access, as much access as we can, both in this implementation time and then as we move forward. 

And so what this season looks like may be different than what it looks like in a couple years. We know with hepatitis B, we started with a different recommendation, and eventually hepatitis B is regularly given in hospitals. 

What we may see in the rollout, in the near term, is that more of this is given in an outpatient setting. I think we're going to have to see how we balance all of these implementation issues and work with you all to make sure that as much access as possible for young infants is going to happen, because it is.

Stepping back, this is a really exciting moment. I know any of us who have taken care of children with RSV, I remember back in residency admitting 20 kids in a night that had RSV. I mean, this is really an amazing time. And so I think if we all work together, we will figure out some of these implementation issues.

...

Grace Lee, ACIP [02:11:06]

So vote number one, infants age less than eight months, born during or entering their first RSV season, are recommended to receive one dose of nirsevimab. I'm just going to ask our ACIP members, if there's any additional discussion or conversation people would like to have before we open it up for voting. But I appreciate my colleagues already putting on their cameras for the vote in preparation. 

...

Melinda Wharton, CDC [02:13:35]

We have 10 yes votes, and it's unanimous.

...

Grace Lee, ACIP [02:13:43]

With that, we will move on to vote number two. So children age 8 to 19 months who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease and entering their second RSV season are recommended to receive one dose of nirsevimab at the dose indicated there. 

...

Grace Lee, ACIP [02:15:51]

So I believe we have 10 yes's, zero no's. Dr. Wharton, could you please confirm? 

Melinda Wharton, CDC [02:16:02]

That's correct, Dr. Lee. 

...

Grace Lee, ACIP [02:22:29]

Approve the Vaccines for Children resolution for nirsevimab for RSV? It's been moved and seconded that we consider this vote. 

...

Grace Lee, ACIP [02:23:56]

And we have 11 yes's I believe. And zero no's. And with that, I believe Dr. Wharton, have we passed the VFC resolution?

Melinda Wharton, CDC [02:24:05]

Yes, thank you. The VFC resolution has passed.

...

Jose Romero, CDC [00:50:28]

I would be remiss if I didn't say that today is a historic event. I think that we will look back on this, in a short period of time, and see what a major impact this vote has had on the health and wellbeing of children in the United States. I think that this will mark one of the major accomplishments of the ACIP. So congratulations to all of you.

### From an FDA spokesperson about gastroparesis after GLP-1 agonist medications

Diabetic gastroparesis is a complication of diabetes that most commonly occurs in patients with long-standing (5 years or longer) or poorly controlled disease, and its cause is not fully understood. It is unclear whether the GLP-1 agonist medications used in patients with type 2 diabetes contribute to the occurrence of diabetic gastroparesis.  

Patients with gastroparesis have not been routinely excluded from clinical trials of long-acting GLP-1 agonists for diabetes indications (including cardiovascular outcomes trials) or chronic weight management indications, and the benefits of these medications may outweigh the risks in some patients with gastroparesis or delayed gastric emptying. For some long-acting GLP-1 products, patients with severe gastrointestinal disorders were excluded from clinical trials and labeling states that use is not recommended in these patients. 

The FDA monitors the safety of drugs throughout their life cycle, including post-approval. In addition, the FDA maintains a system of postmarketing surveillance and risk assessment programs to identify and evaluate adverse events that did not appear during the drug development process. If newly identified safety signals are identified, the FDA will determine what actions are appropriate after a thorough review of the body of evidence.

## August 2, 2023

### From a Sanofi "Second quarter 2023 results" [webcast](https://www.sanofi.com/en/investors/financial-results-and-events/financial-results/q2-results-2023) on July 28

Thomas Triomphe, Sanofi [00:21:55]

Most importantly, we are fully on track to launch Beyfortus this fall to protect babies going through the first RSV season and to relieve parents and the healthcare systems from the heavy burden of RSV disease.

In the U.S., Beyfortus was approved on July 17th for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in infants. Building up on this key milestone, an added ACIP meeting is now set for early next week, on August 3rd, to discuss nirsevimab use for the coming season with both a recommendation vote and a Vaccines for Children program inclusion vote scheduled. 

...

Thomas Triomphe, Sanofi [00:41:15]

Registered July 17th, ACIP next week August 3rd, we are very excited and confident about the forthcoming recommendation and the voting. Why?

I think I want to explain that there has been great work with the ACIP over the past few weeks, and we've been really reassured by the ACIP recognition of the burden of RSV disease for all infants. So a clear recommendation for all infants is critical, and will be successful, in my view, to ensure equitable access across the population, which is a very important part to look at when it comes to prevention. 

So during ACIP meetings in the past, key stakeholders have clearly expressed their interest in ensuring that both and equitable access, and therefore, that gives us confidence. Similarly, we expect inclusion into the VFC program because this decision is critical again, to ensure equitable access for all infants. So moving forward with confidence towards ACIP.

Question [00:42:13]

So I am alright in saying that we we're the only preventative RSV on the agenda at ACIP next week?

Thomas Triomphe, Sanofi [00:42:18]

We are, absolutely. And the second part of the question, so was on price, very similar to what we said in the past, we want to ensure, and that's very much linked to the ACIP recommendation, so both go together. 

If there is a broad ACIP recommendation, we want to ensure there is equitable access for this product to everyone. And therefore it'll be a premium innovative vaccine price, well aligned with what was discussed in terms of pricing during the previous ACIP meetings.

### From an AstraZeneca "H1 and Q2 2023 results" [webcast](https://www.astrazeneca.com/investor-relations/astrazeneca-h1-and-q2-2023-results-event.html) on July 28

Iskra Reic, AstraZeneca [01:08:05]

So we are continue to rapidly advance AZD3152, which is a new long-acting monoclonal antibody for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 for immunocompromised patient. And I'm pleased to say that SUPERNOVA trial is on track.

As you are mentioning, we did update the trial, and that was as a result of the trial design, and that was a result of the consultation and agreement with the because we believe that it's the fastest way of how to achieve emergency approval for the the patients in U.S. And currently the trial is updated with the sub-study or immunobridging data. 

As a reminder, this is a precedent study design, and will allow us to have the data late this year. Obviously, as we are moving from the beginning with, at pace, we will do our best to deliver AZD3152 to the immunocompromised patient in U.S. by end of this year. 

Equally, we are continuing the SUPERNOVA trial with the efficacy end point, and we believe that efficacy data read out will happen in the first quarter of next year, that will allow us to have the approval globally outside of U.S.

On your branding question, thanks for that. I do agree the not having Evusheld brand name for our new next generation monoclonal antibody has its good and bad sides. We are currently into discussion both with FDA and EMA, and we will provide the update on the brand name as soon as we get agreement from those agencies.

### From an Alliance for a Stronger FDA [webinar](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/alliance-webinar-with-dr-namandje-bumpus-tickets-676764329327) titled "A Conversation with FDA Chief Scientist Dr. Namandjé Bumpus"

Namandjé Bumpus, FDA [00:14:19]

In a general sense, these are new authorities provided to us through MoCRA, in a variety of areas, that really give us the ability to get just greater understanding even of the cosmetics industry, for instance, through product facility registration, product listing, there now will be requirements for reporting serious adverse events, mandatory recall authority. So there are really enhancements in the work that we can do. 

In addition, MoCRA requires FDA to establish regulations for good manufacturing practice or GMP requirements. So that's something also that we are working on and had a public meeting around. There are also some things included, rule making around labeling of fragrance allergens, and so there are many components that come to us that we're really enthusiastic about working to implement, and just strengthening the work that we do here around cosmetics.

...

Namandjé Bumpus, FDA [00:15:23]

As far as where we are with implementation. So sunsetted, and announced that we sunsetted, kind of what we had existing, which was a voluntary cosmetics reporting program. And we're working on developing and rolling out our registration and listing system. We, as I mentioned, had a GMP listening session to hear more from industry so that we can leverage those perspectives as we establish the good manufacturing practices, the regulations that we need to put in place. 

As far as implementation, a lot of our timelines are really guided by what is statutory. So for instance, the registration and listing, there is a requirement listed, a statutory requirement, for December 29, 2023, for the system being available and for people being able to register and list there. So we're following really the guidance that we get from the timeframe that is laid out, the timelines laid out in MoCRA, and there's some very specific timelines there that are really governing our work and that we're working to meet. 

But in general, lots of new authorities, our first new authorities in over 80 years, and we're working very hard and very enthusiastic about the work that we can do for public health through MoCRA.

...

Question [00:17:04]

How would you describe compliance with MoCRA requirements so far this year, and what is the best way to describe when and how FDA will begin enforcing any violations that the agency deems?

Namandjé Bumpus, FDA [00:17:18]

So, we're kind of working through the process and rolling things out over time. And so I would say, continue to follow our website for updates as we have decisions. We'll also be sure to provide constituent updates, update the website. We also have a mailbox people can send emails to, to kind of ask some of their specific questions. 

But what I would say is that we have these kind of statutory timelines and we are working towards those, and in my view, on track to meet them. But, obviously there are, these are all multifaceted things, and lots of things in the air, but we are working hard to meet these timelines that are laid out for us. 

We certainly will ensure, as things roll out, that there is reasonable time for implementation by industry. We are listening to people. We hear you, we understand that there's interest in moving forward. And, we are very interested in that too. So as we're working to develop these components, we will ensure that folks are aware of our progress, aware of decision making, aware of when things launch, in that we do provide time for the adjustment to be made and for implementation, for instance, for registration listing. But we'll keep those updates coming. But we want this to work as well for everyone. So we will ensure we have time for implementation for everyone.

...

Namandjé Bumpus, FDA [00:19:13]

We didn't receive any appropriations for this fiscal year, but are really hopeful for funding to implement MoCRA. And we are, like I said, moving forward and making great progress on it. So of course, when you have additional resources, there is more that you can do. So we are getting it done. It is a priority, my office, we have kind of all hands on deck with folks working on this, but of course, additional resources mean that you can do more to implement things, maybe get more done kind of simultaneously, things along those lines. 

So I think that more resources will mean adding to the program as far as how robust it can be, but I want to be clear that we are making progress, even with kind of what we have, and that it is a full and really key priority for our team. And it's something that we're really all working on.

<External Email>

Good morning Alex,

On July 26, 2023, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and Oakland County health departments reported a presumptive positive influenza A(H3) variant virus infection (swine flu) in a person who attended a county fair. A respiratory specimen from that patient was sent to the CDC and was received on July 27. Diagnostic testing conducted at CDC was inconclusive, likely due to the respiratory specimen not containing enough virus.

However, it is likely the patient was infected with an influenza A(H3)v virus given the presumptive positive test results from Michigan, as well as the epidemiologic findings of the local investigation which determined the patient was exposed to pigs within 10 days prior to illness onset at an agricultural fair where influenza A virus was detected among pigs. Additional investigation did not identify respiratory illness in any of the patient’s close contacts or household contacts. No person-to-person transmission of influenza A(H3)v virus associated with this patient has been identified. This case will be reported in FluView and FluView Interactive on Friday, August 4th. 

CDC recommends people take precautions to prevent the spread of flu viruses between pigs and people when exhibiting pigs or attending agricultural fairs where pigs are present. CDC guidance for people exhibiting pigs at fairs is available at Key Facts for People Exhibiting Pigs at Fairs | CDC, and guidance for fair organizers is available at Issues for Fair Organizers to Consider When Planning Fairs | CDC.

### From Chelsea Wuth of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services

The CDC was unable to confirm the first case in their laboratory. There can be a number of reasons for this but given the exposure history and history of swine positivity at the fair, they didn’t disagree with the assessment that this presumptive case should be addressed as if they were confirmed. Highlighted link should be most helpful for what you are looking for for occurrences.

Swine flu cases are reported as “influenza, novel” in the weekly Flu Focus reports and the Michigan Diseases Surveillance Reports.
