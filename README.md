This [repository](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes-by-alexander-tin) contains [files](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes/tree/main/attachments) and [other notes](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes/tree/main/pages) I gathered while covering the Biden administration's public health agencies, including their response to infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19 or mpox. 

Initially, I was saving them on [Revue](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/revue) before it was shut down by Twitter. More recently, I was organizing them under Github's [Wiki tab](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes/wiki). I moved to publishing them with Github Pages after discovering that would make them [indexable by search engines](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis#:~:text=Note%3A%20Search,a%20public%20repository.).

The notes here **probably contain typos or other errors I haven't noticed**. Please let me know if you spot one!
