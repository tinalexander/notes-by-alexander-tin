This [repository](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes-by-alexander-tin) contains [files](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes/tree/main/attachments) and [other notes](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes/tree/main/pages) I've gathered while covering the Biden administration's public health agencies, including their response to infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19 or mpox, for CBS News.

Initially, I was saving them on [Revue](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/revue) before it was shut down by Twitter. Then I switched to organizing them under Github's [Wiki tab](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes/wiki) before discovering those aren't [indexable by search engines](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis#:~:text=Note%3A%20Search,a%20public%20repository.). Now I am trying to publish them with [Github Pages](https://tinalexander.github.io/notes/).

The notes saved in this repository **probably contain typos or other errors I haven't noticed**. Please let me know if you spot one!

You can reach me by email at [TinA@CBSNews.com](mailto:TinA@CBSNews.com) or through the information on my [Github profile](https://github.com/tinalexander).
