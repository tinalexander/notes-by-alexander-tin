This [repository](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes-by-alexander-tin) contains [files](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes/tree/main/attachments) and [other notes](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes/tree/main/pages) I gathered while covering the Biden administration's public health agencies, including their response to infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19 or mpox. 

Initially, I was saving them on [Revue](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/revue) before it was shut down by Twitter. Recently, I was organizing them under Github's [Wiki tab](https://github.com/tinalexander/notes/wiki), but I switched to publishing them here with Github Pages in hopes of making them [indexable by search engines](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis#:~:text=Note%3A%20Search,a%20public%20repository.).

The notes here probably contain typos or other errors. Please let me know if you spot one!

You can email me at [TinA@CBSNews.com](mailto:TinA@CBSNews.com). More about me can be found [Github profile](https://github.com/tinalexander).
