> Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO [00:12:00]
> 
> We are seeing, in general, an increase in respiratory infections around the world. 
> 
> We do tend to see increases in children, because they're the school age children in the northern hemisphere, we're entering it's the autumn already, and we're entering the winter months. So we are expecting to see increases in acute respiratory infections. 
> 
> Mycoplasma pneumonia is not a reportable disease to WHO, so we tend to track this information through reporting systems and through discussions with our member states. 
> 
> We have seen as we, you and I had discussed earlier or last week, we are following up with the situation in China. And again, they have seen overall an increase in acute respiratory infections due to a number of different pathogens,  including influenza, which is on the rise, mycoplasma pneumonia was on the rise for the last couple of months, and now seems to be a little bit on the decline. 
> 
> We're following up through our clinical networks and working with clinicians in China to better understand resistance to antibiotics, which is a problem across the world, but is a particular problem in the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia region. 
> 
> We do-- one of the things we are following up on, in terms of the acute respiratory infections is looking at burden in healthcare systems. So it's one thing to see arise in these types of infections, particularly in school-aged children, but also to monitor the severity in looking at the healthcare capacities around the world, to be able to deal with these types of infections, looking at what are the treatment options that are there. And there are many antibiotics that are available for mycoplasma pneumonia. 
> 
> I don't have the specifics on the rates around the country, around the world, for this particular bacteria, but we have seen outbreaks of mycoplasma pneumonia in a number of countries over the course of many different years.
>

> Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO [00:14:55]
> 
> So we are continuing to track the variants around the world, and BA.2.86 was recently classified as a variant of interest. It was formally a variant under monitoring.
> 
> Within BA.2.86, includes this further sub lineage of JN.1.
> 
> Globally, we have about 10% of the sequences that are reported to public platforms are BA.2.86 and its sub lineages. 
> 
> In terms of our assessment, there's still very small numbers, so I don't have the exact number of sequences in this grouping, but it's around 4,000, just over 4,000 sequences globally. 
> 
> It has a growth advantage, but this is what we expect from variants that are classified as variants of interest. 
> 
> In terms of severity, we don't see a change in the disease profile of people infected with BA.2.86 and its sublineages, including JN.1, but it is one of course to watch. 
> 
> When we look at severity, we are looking at any changes in hospitalizations. We are looking at any changes in disease presentation, and we don't see that, for this particular variant of interest and its sub lineages. 
> 
> So again, anyone who is infected with SARS-CoV-2, including BA.2.86 and its sub lineages can cause the full range of disease, everything from asymptomatic infection, all the way to severe disease and death.
