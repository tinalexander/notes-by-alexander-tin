## CDC official on wastewater surveillance plans

- **Source:** [meeting](https://www.cdc.gov/ddid/BSC.html) of Board of Scientific Counselors, Deputy Director for Infectious Diseases
- **Date:** broadcasted November 30, 2023

> Amy Kirby, CDC [00:35:30]
> 
> We have just this week launched this new metric, called the wastewater viral activity level. 
> 
> One of the real challenges with wastewater data is that, although what we measure is the concentration for SARS-CoV-2, it's of RNA in wastewater, that concentration is not comparable between sites because the design and operation of the wastewater system itself influences the number that you get. 
> 
> So we have to use other metrics to make the data as comparable as we can. And now that we have nice historical data to pull from, we're able to put together this wastewater activity level. 
> 
> So we look at the last year of data from a site, and determine what the 10th percentile is of concentrations and set that as the baseline for that site. And then our viral activity level, wastewater viral activity level, is the number of standard deviations above or below that value.
> 
> And the advantage here is that it gives you a very interpretable line. It's a linear scale. So it works very well for the public. Also it aggregates very well. So you can take the median of that wastewater viral activity level, and look at state trends or regional or national trends, which is what you're seeing here. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Amy Kirby, CDC [00:41:43]
> 
> We aren't going to be able to test everything. Waste water has potential for a lot of things, but we have to be judicious in the use of our limited resources. And so how do we make choices about what we can use wastewater surveillance for? 
> 
> And we expect this to be an iterative and ongoing process, because certainly we can use it for pandemic preparedness, that is what it was designed for a pandemic. So having it in place for the next one, should that happen, will get us there even faster. 
> 
> But we're also thinking about how can we use this for emergency response. So, I come from the field of water quality. So I think about, what do we do in the wake of large floods, where we start being worried about waterborne infections. If we have wastewater surveillance in those areas, you could think about a local short term activation of the wastewater surveillance system in that area to look for things like shigellosis or norovirus that we get concerned about in the wake of these types of emergencies. 
> 
> Other emergencies have similar infectious disease concerns. 
> 
> We're interested in using this to understand more about emerging infections.
> 
> A really great example here is enterovirus D 68, where we see these bi-annual cycles of severe infection in children, but we really don't know much about community infections outside of those periods of severe cases. 
> 
> Wastewater surveillance may allow us to get a better idea of what's going on with those infections, even when they're very mild or asymptomatic. 
> 
> And finally, as Dr Houry indicated, there are applications here for bioterrorism and potentially biopreparedness. So we're working with some of our partners to understand where those have potential and  how we can best connect to those systems. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Amy Kirby, CDC [00:45:14]
> 
> For example, I get a lot of questions about Ebola, and for Ebola, we know that there's very few, if any asymptomatic cases, symptom onset is very soon after infection, and so although we likely could detect it quite easily in wastewater, by the time we had that data in hand in the U.S., a person would already have sought medical care and would likely already be diagnosed clinically. 
> 
> So we're not getting any added value by wastewater for that. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Amy Kirby, CDC [00:53:24]
> 
> The coverage question I think is excellent. And one that we're really wrestling with
> 
> In the central states where you are noting that we don't have a lot of coverage, there's also not a lot of wastewater treatment plants in those areas. So if you look at the map of treatment plants, there's also a hole there. 
> 
> But how can we address that? Are there other ways around that? Do we need to oversample those few waste water treatment plants that are in the central area because we know we don't have a lot of other coverage there? Are there communities that use like shared septic systems that we might could treat like a treatment plant? 
> 
> I think we can put some creative thought into that and I would-- that's one of the things that we really welcome input from the board on how best to address that.
> 
> ...
> 
> Amy Kirby, CDC [00:55:42]
> 
> CFA is leading on that for COVID. And we're working with the respiratory virus response for COVID and then we will have flu and RSV data very soon. So we'll be adding that as well. 
> 
> It gets more complicated as you get into other pathogens. And so this is a process that we'll have to go through with every new pathogen that we add because their existing surveillance is quite different. 
> 
> For example, we're thinking about norovirus next year and antimicrobial resistance genes, and those all have very different clinical surveillance systems, but we're working on how to integrate those internally so that we can make sure that the sort of pathogen programs at CDC have access to the data and understand what it means and how to use it. 
> 
> But we're also thinking about how can we present that externally to people so that whatever they come to the CDC page looking for, if they come looking for information on norovirus, they see clinical and wastewater data. 
> 
> If they come looking for wastewater data, they get all of the things that we do. So however they come to us, they're going to see the data that's relevant to that question.
> 
> CDC's working on a new, um, sort of backside for their website that makes that much easier. So looking forward to seeing how we can integrate that going forward, but I also think improved communications around wastewater surveillance, and as you say, translation into action, both for the public as well as for public health and clinical practitioners is going to be really important. 

## CDC director on pneumonia and respiratory infections

- **Source:** press briefing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
- **Date:** hosted December 1, 2023

> Mandy Cohen, CDC (recording 1 of 3) [00:09:52]
> 
> As of today, we are not seeing anything that is atypical in terms of pneumonia related emergency department visits. 
> 
> But we do know that there are a lot of kids going to the emergency department with respiratory illnesses like RSV, and flu, and COVID.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC (recording 3 of 3) [00:00:16]
> 
> The manufacturers had delays in their production process which led to limited supply. 
> 
> We've been working to accelerate what we can to get additional doses for this season. The 70 thousand was a first effort. There have been additional doses that have been released and we do expect more doses in the early January time frame as well. 
> 
> So we're-- we do still expect more doses, but we still know that they're-- this keeps us in a place of limited supply for this season. 
> 
> It is why CDC issued guidance to target those doses to the most high risk babies, babies who have underlying lung disease, who are younger, who were born as premies, to our Alaska Native population who are at higher risk. 
> 
> So we are trying to make sure that we are focusing those limited doses on our both high-risk kids.
> 
> And I should say we continue to work with manufacturers nearly daily to work to accelerate additional doses. 
> 
> As you know this RSV immunization is a long acting monoclonal antibody. So it does have a different production life cycle than a vaccine. It does take longer to produce and it is just a different way of producing than vaccines and does take longer.
>
> So that that's the time cycle here, but we continue to work with manufacturers to do everything we can to accelerate. We expect more doses in January, but we will still see the limited supply for the season.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC (recording 2 of 3) [00:05:02]
> 
> In terms of how we monitor respiratory illness overall, which includes viruses and bacteria and fungal infections, we use data that comes to us from our emergency departments across the country, more than 80% of them report in on a daily basis of what folks are are coming in with, from those sources. 
> 
> We also are able to look at laboratory data. And at this time, what we are seeing is quite typical of this moment in the winter respiratory virus season. 
> 
> So we are seeing typical patterns as well as typical pathogens that are causing sicknesses in our kids and frankly at all ages. So we are seeing COVID and flu and RSV as well as some pneumonia, but nothing outside the typical of what we would see.
> 
> Obviously we're gonna continue to monitor these trends, but they are pretty typical of what we would see at this point.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC (recording 2 of 3 [00:06:22]
> 
> We've been in touch with the folks in Ohio, and again, we are seeing similar trends that they would typically see during this season. Hospital capacity is fine. Children are recovering at home. 
> 
> These are pathogens that are known to us -- flu, COVID, RSV, mycoplasma. There's no evidence that any of those increases are connected to other outbreaks nationally or internationally. 
> 
> So we will continue to monitor it, but we don't see anything yet at this moment that is out of the ordinary.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC (recording 2 of 3) [00:09:05]
> 
> We have been in touch with the folks in Ohio. 
> 
> And what I would say is we are seeing respiratory illnesses that can be caused by viruses or bacteria. 
> 
> So we are seeing flu, we're seeing RSV, we're seeing COVID, and we're seeing mycoplasma, which is a bacteria. 
> 
> So the first three are viruses flu, COVID, RSV, all viruses, mycoplasma is one type of bacteria that can cause pneumonia, it's often referred to as walking pneumonia, but then there are other bacteria, strep and others that can cause pneumonia. 
> 
> So what we are hearing from Ohio, that again, there have been no reported deaths. Most of these cases are receiving treatment and recovering at home as you reported, either because they're being treated for the bacteria with an antibiotic, or they're being treated with an antiviral for the virus they have.
> 
> There is no evidence again that these are atypical from what we would see at this moment in time. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC (recording 2 of 3) [00:10:42]
> 
> I want to reiterate that hospital capacity is fine. And again, we're not seeing strains at the children's hospitals in Ohio. 
> 
> These are from pathogens that we know, we want folks to get treated for, and again, pretty typical of what we would see at this season.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC (recording 2 of 3) [00:12:14]
> 
> We're also in touch with private labs regarding testing for pneumonia.
> 
> Based on our assessment today, at this point, we're seeing activity that is very typical for the season. Again, typical means we are seeing more respiratory illnesses, more flu, more COVID, more RSV, and more pneumonia, but typical for what we're seeing. 
> 
> So there're not any patterns across the country that we are seeing that are out of the ordinary, but we continue to monitor.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC (recording 2 of 3) [00:12:51]
> 
> In terms of our ability to corroborate, so we work with our international partners to, in terms of making sure that what we are hearing is also similar to what they are seeing as well, being in touch with our Chinese counterparts in public health, in academia, in health delivery systems. 
> 
> And we were, what we have all been able to ascertain, is that there is no novel pathogen, not a new pathogen here, but this is all related to upticks of known viruses and bacteria in their pediatric population.

## WHO officials on mycoplasma pneumonia and JN.1 variant

- **Source:** [press briefing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2HrRZ7-Cls&t=1s) by the World Health Organization
- **Date:** broadcasted November 29, 2023

> Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO [00:12:00]
> 
> We are seeing, in general, an increase in respiratory infections around the world. 
> 
> We do tend to see increases in children, because they're the school age children in the northern hemisphere, we're entering it's the autumn already, and we're entering the winter months. So we are expecting to see increases in acute respiratory infections. 
> 
> Mycoplasma pneumonia is not a reportable disease to WHO, so we tend to track this information through reporting systems and through discussions with our member states. 
> 
> We have seen as we, you and I had discussed earlier or last week, we are following up with the situation in China. And again, they have seen overall an increase in acute respiratory infections due to a number of different pathogens,  including influenza, which is on the rise, mycoplasma pneumonia was on the rise for the last couple of months, and now seems to be a little bit on the decline. 
> 
> We're following up through our clinical networks and working with clinicians in China to better understand resistance to antibiotics, which is a problem across the world, but is a particular problem in the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia region. 
> 
> We do-- one of the things we are following up on, in terms of the acute respiratory infections is looking at burden in healthcare systems. So it's one thing to see arise in these types of infections, particularly in school-aged children, but also to monitor the severity in looking at the healthcare capacities around the world, to be able to deal with these types of infections, looking at what are the treatment options that are there. And there are many antibiotics that are available for mycoplasma pneumonia. 
> 
> I don't have the specifics on the rates around the country, around the world, for this particular bacteria, but we have seen outbreaks of mycoplasma pneumonia in a number of countries over the course of many different years.
> 
> ...
> 
> Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO [00:14:55]
> 
> So we are continuing to track the variants around the world, and BA.2.86 was recently classified as a variant of interest. It was formally a variant under monitoring.
> 
> Within BA.2.86, includes this further sub lineage of JN.1.
> 
> Globally, we have about 10% of the sequences that are reported to public platforms are BA.2.86 and its sub lineages. 
> 
> In terms of our assessment, there's still very small numbers, so I don't have the exact number of sequences in this grouping, but it's around 4,000, just over 4,000 sequences globally. 
> 
> It has a growth advantage, but this is what we expect from variants that are classified as variants of interest. 
> 
> In terms of severity, we don't see a change in the disease profile of people infected with BA.2.86 and its sublineages, including JN.1, but it is one of course to watch. 
> 
> When we look at severity, we are looking at any changes in hospitalizations. We are looking at any changes in disease presentation, and we don't see that, for this particular variant of interest and its sub lineages. 
> 
> So again, anyone who is infected with SARS-CoV-2, including BA.2.86 and its sub lineages can cause the full range of disease, everything from asymptomatic infection, all the way to severe disease and death.
