## Biden administration press briefing on Medicare Advantage
 
- **Source**: press briefing hosted by the Biden administration
- **Date**: broadcasted November 6, 2023

> Lael Brainard, White Hous [01:41:22]
> 
> Medicare Advantage serves over 30 million American seniors. Medicare advantage brokers and agents are supposed to help seniors find plans that best meet the needs of those seniors. But currently some large Medicare Advantage insurance companies are wooing brokers and agents with lavish perks like cash bonuses and golf trips to incentivize them to steer seniors to those large plans. That's not right. 
> 
> Seniors should get the plan that is based on their needs in their best interest. Not based on which plan has the biggest payoff for marketers.
> 
> Today's proposed rule would, if finalized as proposed, tighten limits on broker and agent compensation to make sure seniors get access to the plan that best meets their needs rather than the best perks for the broker. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Xavier Becerra, HHS [01:45:59]
> 
> We're going to improve Medicare managed care plans by curbing predatory market practices and inappropriate steering that distorts healthy competition among all the different plans.
> The proposed rule we're announcing will help people with Medicare select and then enroll in coverage options that best meet their healthcare needs. 
> 
> This helps close loopholes that allow Medicare managed care plans to inappropriately inflate agents and brokers commissions by adding junk fees. 
> 
> We are intent on ensuring that Medicare enrollment, the process itself, helps individuals who are searching for a Medicare option that best meets their needs. 
> We don't need a system that just funnels people into certain insurance plans and further just consolidates the market. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Chiquita Brooks Lasure, CMS [01:49:20]
> 
> Many people with Medicare rely on agents and brokers to help them make the best choice about their healthcare coverage. However, we are concerned that some Medicare Advantage plans are compensating agents and brokers in a way that may circumvent existing payment rules inappropriately, and anti-competitively, steering people to enroll in plans that do not best meet their needs leading to further consolidation in the Medicare Advantage market. 
> 
> This is bad for people, bad for consumer choice, and bad for competition. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Senior Administration Official [01:54:33]
> 
> We have had limits in the past on what brokers have been compensated, but there were a number of activities that were outside of compensation. So some of the examples that you heard Lael mentioned were being offered outside of compensation. 
> 
> So we're broadening the definition and putting it, those things, under the cap.

## CMS spokesperson on impact of Stelara biosimilar for Medicare drug price talks

- **Source:** email from CMS spokesperson
- **Date:** received Thursday, November 2

> The following responses are on background and attributable to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) or a CMS spokesperson:
> 
> CMS firmly supports a robust biosimilars market and believes that the policies for implementing the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program will help support biosimilar entry and price competition.
> 
> Sections 11001 and 11002 of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) (P.L. 117-169), signed into law on August 16, 2022, established the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (Negotiation Program) to enable Medicare to negotiate maximum fair prices (MFPs) with participating manufacturers for certain high expenditure, single source drugs and biological products. On August 29, 2023, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the 10 drugs covered under Medicare Part D selected for the first cycle of negotiations, including Stelara. On October 3, 2023, CMS announced that drug companies that manufacture the first 10 drugs selected for the Negotiation Program have chosen to participate in the program, including Janssen Biotech, Inc., the primary manufacturer of Stelara.
> 
> On October 31, 2023, Amgen, Inc., received a license from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Wezlana (ustekinumab-auub), a biosimilar biological product for Stelara. The FDA licensure of a biosimilar biological product for Stelara does not, standing alone, change Stelara’s status as a selected drug for the first cycle of negotiations currently. However, CMS has now determined that Wezlana has been licensed using Stelara as the reference product, and CMS will continue to engage in its monthly review process to determine if Amgen, Inc., has engaged in marketing of Wezlana.
> 
> If CMS finds that Wezlana is marketed, the timing of that product’s marketing would affect when Stelara is removed from the selected drug list as well as whether or not any agreed-upon MFP would apply (and if so, for how long):
> 
> If Wezlana is found to be marketed on or before August 1, 2024, no MFP would apply in 2026, and Stelara would cease to be a selected drug on January 1, 2027.
> If Wezlana is found to be marketed between August 2, 2024, and March 31, 2026, any agreed-upon MFP would apply in 2026, and Stelara would cease to be a selected drug on January 1, 2027.
> If Wezlana is found to be marketed between April 1, 2026, and March 31, 2027, any agreed-upon MFP would apply in 2026 and 2027, and Stelara would cease to be a selected drug on January 1, 2028.
>  
> During any period in which an MFP for Stelara is not in effect due to licensure and marketing of a biosimilar competitor, the price of Stelara will not be legally constrained by the requirements of the Negotiation Program created by the Inflation Reduction Act.
> 
> For more information, please see sections 30 and 70 of the Revised Guidance for Initial Price Applicability Year 2026 published on June 30, 2023.
