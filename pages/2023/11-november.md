## CMS spokesperson on impact of Stelara biosimilar for Medicare drug price talks

- **Source:** email from CMS spokesperson
- **Date:** received Thursday, November 2

> The following responses are on background and attributable to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) or a CMS spokesperson:
> 
> CMS firmly supports a robust biosimilars market and believes that the policies for implementing the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program will help support biosimilar entry and price competition.
> 
> Sections 11001 and 11002 of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) (P.L. 117-169), signed into law on August 16, 2022, established the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (Negotiation Program) to enable Medicare to negotiate maximum fair prices (MFPs) with participating manufacturers for certain high expenditure, single source drugs and biological products. On August 29, 2023, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the 10 drugs covered under Medicare Part D selected for the first cycle of negotiations, including Stelara. On October 3, 2023, CMS announced that drug companies that manufacture the first 10 drugs selected for the Negotiation Program have chosen to participate in the program, including Janssen Biotech, Inc., the primary manufacturer of Stelara.
> 
> On October 31, 2023, Amgen, Inc., received a license from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Wezlana (ustekinumab-auub), a biosimilar biological product for Stelara. The FDA licensure of a biosimilar biological product for Stelara does not, standing alone, change Stelara’s status as a selected drug for the first cycle of negotiations currently. However, CMS has now determined that Wezlana has been licensed using Stelara as the reference product, and CMS will continue to engage in its monthly review process to determine if Amgen, Inc., has engaged in marketing of Wezlana.
> 
> If CMS finds that Wezlana is marketed, the timing of that product’s marketing would affect when Stelara is removed from the selected drug list as well as whether or not any agreed-upon MFP would apply (and if so, for how long):
> 
> If Wezlana is found to be marketed on or before August 1, 2024, no MFP would apply in 2026, and Stelara would cease to be a selected drug on January 1, 2027.
> If Wezlana is found to be marketed between August 2, 2024, and March 31, 2026, any agreed-upon MFP would apply in 2026, and Stelara would cease to be a selected drug on January 1, 2027.
> If Wezlana is found to be marketed between April 1, 2026, and March 31, 2027, any agreed-upon MFP would apply in 2026 and 2027, and Stelara would cease to be a selected drug on January 1, 2028.
>  
> During any period in which an MFP for Stelara is not in effect due to licensure and marketing of a biosimilar competitor, the price of Stelara will not be legally constrained by the requirements of the Negotiation Program created by the Inflation Reduction Act.
> 
> For more information, please see sections 30 and 70 of the Revised Guidance for Initial Price Applicability Year 2026 published on June 30, 2023.
