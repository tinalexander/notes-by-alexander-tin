> Robert Califf, FDA [00:15:04]
> 
> Although I know traditionally this meeting has been focused on cures with new therapies, I'm all for that. I'm proud of the fact that ever in the world I go, people say the FDA is the best, the U.S. is far and away the leader in innovation, we don't want to back off on that at all.
> 
> But I would argue that the phase 1, 2, 3, and variations of it that we use to move things along, it works pretty darn well, but when things go on the market, we have no system to generate the evidence that we need to know what to do. 
> 
> So we have all these questions that are left on the table, like what, which is better? What really is the right dose? What are the subpopulations where the benefits really outweigh the risk? How do we combine the therapies? How long should we give it? None of those questions are answered for almost all drugs that or devices that come on the market, approved by the FDA. 
> 
> The FDA is tasked by law with saying this is safe and effective for a particular indication in a particular population. That's what you need to prove. Then the label gets written and we need an evidence generation system for the postmarket phase. 
> 
> But of course that's not the FDA's primary mission. And so that will take a ecosystem and a community, which I know is something that you've been working on. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:16:53]
> 
> The FDA has a primary role in nutrition. I've become-- I've been reading a lot about ultra processed foods. 
> 
> There's an argument going on the FDA doesn't act in something like this unless there's definitive evidence, but I would argue for things like nutrition, that same evidence generation system that would be good for post market drugs, let me just throw in dietary supplements into that, if you could do these studies at a low cost and get the answers, we'd know what to do. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:18:52]
> 
> I've sort of been waiting on Monica to get confirmed.
> 
> You know that we've worked together and gotten to know each other well. 
> 
> I've got a little brother with cancer right now. She's been a tremendous personal help. And so I've been able to see the heart and grit that she has.
> 
> I think, to be a cancer surgeon, you sort of have to be tough. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:19:30]
> 
> We need to generate that evidence and we all need to play a role like, what are the little things CMS can do on a grand scale to encourage clinicians to participate in research? What are things NIH can do to change its portfolio just enough that our mammoth academic medical centers pay more attention to the kinds of clinical studies that really make a difference for health outcomes?
> 
> And then across the board, you know, you've worked on this, the use of AI and virtual methodologies to reach people who right now are have a hard time getting to the clinic or the research clinic to generate that evidence. 
> 
> So I think we've got to have that target and we all need to be focused on it. 
> 
> We're doing a little exercise now. 
> 
> I think if you looked in sum at what all the federal agencies and all the voluntary agencies and foundations are putting into what I would call the postmarket system, it's a lot of money, but it's not directed towards a common goal or a system. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:22:31]
> 
> I know we have a limited time. We could talk about this for a long time. 
> 
> Number one, we have to up our game at the FDA in terms of speaking to people in playing English or Spanish or whatever language that they can understand, rather than speaking in the way we're used to speaking in the past, which is speaking to doctors or the industries that we regulate.
> 
> People don't understand well what the FDA does. So we'll do that to the best we possibly can. And there's a Reagan Udall foundation report. I would refer people to that just came out, that lays that out.
> 
> But then we've got a really depend on non-government entities to pick up their game too. 
> 
> I think-- I'm not defeatist. We're going to keep trying within FDA and within government. 
> 
> But the reality is that the misinformation purveyors are at it 24 by 7. 
> 
> We have jobs to do, our communication budget is very limited, we have great communication people who are here, but there're just a few of them relative to the vast expanse of the internet out there. 
> 
> So we need consortia out in the real world, universities, medical centers, industry, voluntary foundations, to create a network that's devoted to promoting the truth. 
> 
> The third thing I'd say is I do think that I'm swung over now that fighting misinformation is actually probably going to be an unsuccessful strategy. 
> 
> But one thing I learned in my work at Alphabet, I think I learned this correctly, the biggest single factor is just how much people hear of one part of it. 
> 
> So the example I'll use, if we put out one press release, that may have a huge impact on the industry, the stock price, whatever, but what the public is hearing is 24 by 7 counter messaging. 
> 
> And so that means you got to have the share of that voice reaching people in the way they're used to getting information, if you're going to change it and gain trust. 
> 
> And so that network that's involved needs to be very personal. It needs to be in the community, interacting with people in a way that they can best receive information.

## Novo Nordisk statement on counterfeit Ozempic reports

- **Source:** email from Novo Nordisk spokesperson
- **Date:** received November 7, 2023

> In close collaboration with FDA, we have taken measures to create awareness of the potential for counterfeit products. We have developed a company press statement that is posted on our U.S. corporate website and includes a guide for identifying counterfeits. We have provided communications to a number of stakeholders, including wholesalers and pharmacists to ensure they are aware of the situation and also able to identify a potential counterfeit semaglutide injectable product. We are also making semaglutide.com available as a resource hub for US consumers, healthcare providers and retailers to provide information about responsible use of semaglutide, including how to recognize a counterfeit product.  

## FDA spokesperson on counterfeit Ozempic reports

- **Source:** email from Jeremy Kahn of the Food and Drug Administration
- **Date:** received November 7, 2023

> At this time, the FDA has no new information to share regarding reports of adverse events related to counterfeit semaglutide.
> 
> The FDA will investigate any report of suspect counterfeit drugs to determine the public health risks and the appropriate regulatory response. The FDA remains vigilant in protecting the U.S. drug supply from these threats.
> 
> While we understand certain drugs are in short supply and patients are having difficulty obtaining their medication, the FDA urges patients to obtain prescription drugs only from state-licensed pharmacies that are located in the U.S., where the FDA and state authorities can assure the quality of drug manufacturing, packaging, distribution and labeling. FDA’s BeSafeRx campaign helps consumers learn about how to safely buy prescription medicines online. FDA recommends patients to talk to their doctor if they have questions about their medicines. 
> 
> We also continue to raise awareness among consumers and healthcare professionals about the dangers of counterfeit drugs: Counterfeit Medicine  FDA.

## Pork producers on FDA's move regarding carbadox

- **Source:** email from National Pork Producers Council spokesperson
- **Date:** received November 7, 2023

> Statement by National Pork Producers Council on Carbadox:
> 
> Carbadox has been safely used for over 45 years in the United States. It is a vital product to treat gastrointestinal disease (swine dysentery) in young pigs, improving their health and welfare. With few interventions available, Carbadox is essential. It is not considered to be medically important to human medicine and is not a concern for antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens. The sponsor of this product has provided extensive research data to FDA showing the safety of Mecadox. NPPC will continue to support the sponsor and advocate for producers’ continued access to critical swine health products. 

## CDC media briefing on syphilis Vital Signs report

- **Source:** media briefing hosted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
- **Date:** broadcasted November 7, 2023

> Debra Houry, CDC [00:01:31]
> 
> CDC is urgently calling attention to the need for healthcare providers, public health systems and communities to step up their efforts to address newborn syphilis. These efforts must reach people where they are so that every mother and baby get the support they need to stay healthy. 
> 
> While the measures we are urging could have a profound effect on many people and families, truly reversing these trends will require increased focus and resources already strained public health systems. And the escalating STI epidemic have brought our nation to a tipping point with newborn syphilis.
> 
> Healthcare and public health systems are scrambling to prevent moms and babies from slipping through the cracks any way they can to truly address this epidemic. We need better infrastructure and new tools to prevent STIs. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Laura Bachmann, CDC [00:04:30]
> 
> The reality is the rise in syphilis in the past several years means most of us live in areas that are now considered to have high rates of syphilis among women of reproductive age. This means providers must seize on opportunities to address syphilis before pregnancy, by offering to screen more sexually active women and their partners on a regular basis, as well as continuing to offer testing to people with other risk factors for syphilis. 
> 
> We also know that overall missed opportunities to prevent newborn syphilis during pregnancy are due to a combination of individual and system level barriers to timely syphilis testing and treatment. These barriers may include lack of ongoing health coverage living in healthcare or maternal care deserts, transportation limitations, challenges posed by substance use disorder, housing, instability, poverty, and racism. 
> 
> And while newborn syphilis cases are increasing nationwide and across every racial and ethnic group, some communities, including those of people who are Black, Hispanic, and American Indian or Alaska Native are experiencing the brunt of the newborn syphilis epidemic. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Laura Bachmann, CDC [00:16:18]
> 
> We are at the, we have right now the highest number of congenital syphilis cases that we've had in more than 30 years. So the number of cases continue to increase. And we're really at a tipping point now with congenital syphilis. 
> 
> And that's again, why we're bringing attention to the issue through the Vital Signs, as well as some of the additional measures we're recommending that providers and public health professionals take in the field to address the epidemic.
> 
> ...
> 
> Laura Bachmann, CDC [00:19:14]
> 
> As you point out, we are in the middle of a Bicillin shortage nationally.
> 
> CDC has issued guidance around prioritization of Bicillin for pregnant people.
> 
> Just to reiterate, Bicillin is the only recommended treatment for pregnant people. There are alternatives for people who are not pregnant. 
> 
> And so we have issued guidance to help providers in strategizing around this in areas where they are experiencing shortage. Not every area in the country is experiencing a shortage.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert McDonald, CDC [00:20:38]
> 
> The increases that we're seeing over the past year are continuing the trajectory that we've seen over the past 10 years. 
> 
> So as we've seen syphilis going up among women, we've seen syphilis going up in babies. 
> 
> So as long as you're seeing increases in women having syphilis, you will continue to see the increases of syphilis among babies. 
> 
> And that is why we're recommending really looking at geographic risk, when you're assessing a patient, whether or not they should be tested for syphilis.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert McDonald, CDC [00:21:11]
> 
> As for the Bicillin shortage question, up until this point, we've received no reports of anyone who have not been able to get access to Bicillin for treatment during pregnancy. 
> 
> And so CDC works closely with states to make sure that they can be linked up with Bicillin in the case of someone who was pregnant.

## Biden administration press briefing on Medicare Advantage
 
- **Source**: press briefing hosted by the Biden administration
- **Date**: broadcasted November 6, 2023

> Lael Brainard, White Hous [01:41:22]
> 
> Medicare Advantage serves over 30 million American seniors. Medicare advantage brokers and agents are supposed to help seniors find plans that best meet the needs of those seniors. But currently some large Medicare Advantage insurance companies are wooing brokers and agents with lavish perks like cash bonuses and golf trips to incentivize them to steer seniors to those large plans. That's not right. 
> 
> Seniors should get the plan that is based on their needs in their best interest. Not based on which plan has the biggest payoff for marketers.
> 
> Today's proposed rule would, if finalized as proposed, tighten limits on broker and agent compensation to make sure seniors get access to the plan that best meets their needs rather than the best perks for the broker. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Xavier Becerra, HHS [01:45:59]
> 
> We're going to improve Medicare managed care plans by curbing predatory market practices and inappropriate steering that distorts healthy competition among all the different plans.
> The proposed rule we're announcing will help people with Medicare select and then enroll in coverage options that best meet their healthcare needs. 
> 
> This helps close loopholes that allow Medicare managed care plans to inappropriately inflate agents and brokers commissions by adding junk fees. 
> 
> We are intent on ensuring that Medicare enrollment, the process itself, helps individuals who are searching for a Medicare option that best meets their needs. 
> We don't need a system that just funnels people into certain insurance plans and further just consolidates the market. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Chiquita Brooks Lasure, CMS [01:49:20]
> 
> Many people with Medicare rely on agents and brokers to help them make the best choice about their healthcare coverage. However, we are concerned that some Medicare Advantage plans are compensating agents and brokers in a way that may circumvent existing payment rules inappropriately, and anti-competitively, steering people to enroll in plans that do not best meet their needs leading to further consolidation in the Medicare Advantage market. 
> 
> This is bad for people, bad for consumer choice, and bad for competition. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Senior Administration Official [01:54:33]
> 
> We have had limits in the past on what brokers have been compensated, but there were a number of activities that were outside of compensation. So some of the examples that you heard Lael mentioned were being offered outside of compensation. 
> 
> So we're broadening the definition and putting it, those things, under the cap.

## CMS spokesperson on impact of Stelara biosimilar for Medicare drug price talks

- **Source:** email from CMS spokesperson
- **Date:** received Thursday, November 2

> The following responses are on background and attributable to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) or a CMS spokesperson:
> 
> CMS firmly supports a robust biosimilars market and believes that the policies for implementing the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program will help support biosimilar entry and price competition.
> 
> Sections 11001 and 11002 of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) (P.L. 117-169), signed into law on August 16, 2022, established the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (Negotiation Program) to enable Medicare to negotiate maximum fair prices (MFPs) with participating manufacturers for certain high expenditure, single source drugs and biological products. On August 29, 2023, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the 10 drugs covered under Medicare Part D selected for the first cycle of negotiations, including Stelara. On October 3, 2023, CMS announced that drug companies that manufacture the first 10 drugs selected for the Negotiation Program have chosen to participate in the program, including Janssen Biotech, Inc., the primary manufacturer of Stelara.
> 
> On October 31, 2023, Amgen, Inc., received a license from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Wezlana (ustekinumab-auub), a biosimilar biological product for Stelara. The FDA licensure of a biosimilar biological product for Stelara does not, standing alone, change Stelara’s status as a selected drug for the first cycle of negotiations currently. However, CMS has now determined that Wezlana has been licensed using Stelara as the reference product, and CMS will continue to engage in its monthly review process to determine if Amgen, Inc., has engaged in marketing of Wezlana.
> 
> If CMS finds that Wezlana is marketed, the timing of that product’s marketing would affect when Stelara is removed from the selected drug list as well as whether or not any agreed-upon MFP would apply (and if so, for how long):
> 
> If Wezlana is found to be marketed on or before August 1, 2024, no MFP would apply in 2026, and Stelara would cease to be a selected drug on January 1, 2027.
> If Wezlana is found to be marketed between August 2, 2024, and March 31, 2026, any agreed-upon MFP would apply in 2026, and Stelara would cease to be a selected drug on January 1, 2027.
> If Wezlana is found to be marketed between April 1, 2026, and March 31, 2027, any agreed-upon MFP would apply in 2026 and 2027, and Stelara would cease to be a selected drug on January 1, 2028.
>  
> During any period in which an MFP for Stelara is not in effect due to licensure and marketing of a biosimilar competitor, the price of Stelara will not be legally constrained by the requirements of the Negotiation Program created by the Inflation Reduction Act.
> 
> For more information, please see sections 30 and 70 of the Revised Guidance for Initial Price Applicability Year 2026 published on June 30, 2023.
