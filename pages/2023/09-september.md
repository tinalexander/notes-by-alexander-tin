## FDA advisory meeting on artificial womb development

- **Source:** [webcast](https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/pediatric-advisory-committee/2023-meeting-materials-pediatric-advisory-committee) by Food and Drug Administration of the Pediatric Advisory Committee
- **Date:** broadcasted September 20, 2023

> Kalkidan Molla, FDA [09:36:01]
> 
> Preterm birth is a significant public health issue in the U.S.
> 
> Infants born premature, defined as less than 37 weeks gestational age, represented 10% of all live births in 2020, but accounted for 65% of deaths in infants less than 12 months of age. 
> 
> The disproportionate contribution to infant mortality is more striking in the most premature infants, where 40% of all infant deaths occurred in extremely preterm infants born less than 28 weeks gestational age, although these infants represented only 0.6% of all live persons.
> 
> Among survivors of extreme prematurity, morbidity rates are high in infants treated with the current standard of care. Artificial womb technology devices are intended to treat extremely premature infants, or EPIs, after 22 weeks gestational age, by providing a bridge from extreme preterm birth to later gestation within a physiologic environment that mimics the womb.
> 
> ...
> 
> Elizabeth Durmowicz, FDA [09:46:43]
> 
> We need data from clinical trials and children to understand if medical products are safe and effective in children for their intended use. We need these data to protect children from exposure to medical products that may be unsafe or ineffective in children or in a subpopulation of children. 
> 
> However, we recognize that children are a vulnerable population who cannot consent for themselves, and therefore are afforded additional safeguards when participating in clinical investigations. Safeguards for children are considered essential requirements for the enrollment of children in clinical trials to support medical product development. 
> 
> With the understanding that we need to conduct research in children, but we must do so in a way that protects this vulnerable population, FDA promulgated regulations governing the enrollment of children in clinical trials that embrace fundamental ethical principles. 
> 
> An important principle is related to necessity. This principle holds that children should only be enrolled in a clinical trial if the scientific or public health objectives are important to the health and welfare of children and cannot be met through enrolling subjects who can consent personally. 
> 
> Another principle is about limitations of risks. Specifically, if a trial does not offer the prospect or direct benefit to the individually enrolled child in the trial, the risk to which the child may be exposed must be low for children. There is a limit to the risk that knowledge alone can justify and risks in a trial should be minimized. 
> 
> Also, children should not be placed at a disadvantage by being enrolled in a clinical trial, either through exposure to excessive risks or by failing to get necessary healthcare or interventions. In addition, children should have a suitable proxy to provide permission or informed consent for them to enroll in a clinical trial. 
> 
> ...
> 
> An Massaro, FDA [10:03:10]
> 
> It is important to distinguish between the benefit risk assessment that occurs later in the device development life cycle, where approval of a pre-marketing application would require support that the benefits of the device outweigh any associated risk to patients. 
> 
> This assessment is supported by data that is generated during clinical development of the device. 
> 
> In contrast, when we are thinking about benefit versus risk to determine whether it's ethically permissible to proceed with a first in human trial of AWT device, we need to make an assessment of the prospect of clinical benefits and potential device related risks. And we need to make sure that this assessment is judged to be as favorable as known outcomes with standard of care in the neonatal intensive care unit.
> 
> In order to make this assessment, we need to review the outcomes we are achieving currently in the proposed patient population, which in the case of the extremely pre-term infant is variable by each completed week of gestation, as well as by the institution where care is received.
> 
>  We will hear more about this from Dr. Hans later today. 
> 
> We also need to understand the available data to support prospect of benefit and safety of the investigational device. While data from animal models and relevant clinical experience may help inform this assessment, we recognize that there will always be some unknowns that will need to be accepted as part of the transition to initial clinical use. 
> 
> The most challenging question is to answer how much unknown is acceptable. 
> 
> ...
> 
> An Massaro, FDA [10:10:42]
> 
> Returning to the concept of conducting a benefit risk assessment. 
> 
> We need to consider both whether there is support for prospect of direct benefit and adequate safety and mitigation of residual risk. 
> 
> With regards to benefit, we will look to animal models to provide data, to support that the intended effect of the device can be achieved. That is organ growth and maturation are supported while potentially reducing at least some of the atrogenic insults that may contribute to adverse outcomes.
> 
> With regards to risk. We will again rely on animal models to help inform risk, but note that as we will soon hear from Dr. Zan, differences between species may limit translation of safety. And we will also need to look where possible at relevant clinical experience to help fill gaps. 
> 
> As I mentioned previously, even with the most comprehensive non-clinical program to develop an investigational AWT device, we expect that there will be unknowns at the time of initiating a first in human trial of such a highly innovative therapy. 
> 
> We will need to weigh the totality of the evidence to support that any proposed device has the data to support the potential to achieve the intended benefit of improving mortality and morbidity in the extremely pre-term infant. 
> 
> And that device related risks can be adequately mitigated to ensure that the benefit risk determination is at least as favorable as current standard of care in the NICU. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Alan Flake, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia [10:34:10]
> 
> We set out to design the technology to maintain normal fetal physiology and to mimic as closely as possible the environment of the maternal womb. 
> 
> By maintaining fetal physiology and extending gestation, this technology is expected to improve the survival and wellbeing of extreme premature neonates. An important safety feature of the technology is that it allows the neonates to be quickly transferred to the standard of care, if the technology fails for any reason.
> 
> The essential components of the artificial womb are first a sterile fluid environment maintained by continuous fluid exchange, that is fresh fluid in and waste fluid out. Second, a pump-less, low resistance, low surface area, arterial venous oxygenator circuit, powered by the fetal heart rather than a pump. 
> 
> And third is the use of the umbilical vessels as a vascular conduit. Very simple in concept.
> 
> ...
> 
> Alan Flake, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia [10:37:21]
> 
> So why the lamb model? Most of what we know about fetal physiology has been defined in the lamb model and for the most part has been validated in our understanding of human fetal physiology and development.
> 
> The fetal lamb is the only model that I am aware of that is large enough at developmentally relevant time points to fulfill the surgical and mechanical requirements for development of the artificial womb. 
> 
> The primary models are simply too small, 100 to 200 grams at developmentally relevant time points, with umbilical blood flow too limited to utilize current oxygenator technology. 
> 
> ...
> 
> George Mychaliska, University of Michigan Health [10:58:19]
> 
> We are currently in the midst of a prospective study, including other variables, including markers of morbidity. Clinical application would utilize existing NICU and ECMO platforms, with modifications such as perfluorocarbon filled lungs, which we have used in a previous clinical trial of congenital diaphragmic hernia patients on ECMO.
> 
> Early application of the artificial placenta on the first day of life, after risk startification, would be expected to reinitiate fetal circulation with minimal barotrauma.
> 
> For premature infants not captured on the first day of life and subsequently fail maximum medical therapy, the artificial placenta would be applied as a rescue therapy. 
> 
> We recognize there are many ethical and regulatory considerations prior to clinical translation. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mike Seed, The Hospital for Sick Children Toronto [11:07:04]
> 
> In conclusion, we have yet to achieve consistent physiologic, fetal circulatory parameters in our model.
> 
> We believe this is due to our circuit imposing abnormal cardiac loading conditions on the fetal heart, which is perhaps not surprising considering our use of devices that were not designed for this purpose. 
> 
> However, we remain extremely enthusiastic about the potential of artificial womb technology and are about to embark on a new set of experiments using a third iteration of our circuit. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Alan Flake, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia [11:18:32]
> 
> That's one of the limitations of the animal model is that sheep are quite difficult to survive after any intervention in which they are not normally delivered and placed on ventilation, etcetera. 
> 
> And that relates to their multiple stomachs, swallowing air when they're on the ventilator, competing with their respirations, etcetera. 
> 
> So we have survived four lambs after being in the system. One of them was followed up for over six months and we saw no obvious morbidity in the lab. Now that's a limited assessment obviously. 
> 
> We did do neurocognitive assessment in the lab and some other testing, but we could see no evidence of abnormality, but this isn't, obviously, relevant to long term human morbidity after the use of the artificial womb. 
> 
> And I think that's going to rely on long term follow up of any subjects that are placed on the artificial womb for many years, actually to see what its long term effects may be.
> 
> ...
> 
> Alan Flake, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia [11:58:17]
> 
> I would respectably disagree with Mike. I don't think that it's size related, if you think about normal fetal physiology, the normal fetus at whatever size tolerates a pump less AV system. So it's a matter of circuit specifications, circuit resistance, circuit volume, et cetera. 
> 
> We've been able to maintain animals that are equivalent in size to the human infant, meaning in the 6 to 700 gram range, meaning lambs, for long durations on our system. And the Perth group was able to maintain them for approximately two weeks, although they did have some issues with maintaining physiologic flows for that period of time.
> 
> We've been able to maintain, as I said, a 700 gram animal for 29 days in fairly normal physiologic conditions. 
> 
> So I don't think it's a matter of size. I think it's a matter of the circuit specifications with respect to the pig model. I'll have more to say about that tomorrow, but we've been able to rapidly convert pig fetuses that are human in size from placental support to circuit support with physiologic blood flows. 
> 
> And, I'll discuss more about that tomorrow, but it has not been a limitation in our system to run pigs for short duration physiologically.
> 
> ...
> 
> George Mychaliska, University of Michigan Health [12:08:03]
> 
> It's a great question. So I will say that we do need to-- we don't paralyze the animals, but we do give them benzos and some narcotics to keep them comfortable. And in those video clips, the animals don't move very much. 
> 
> And I didn't capture in that video, we have early in our experience, we would cap the endotracheal tube. So it was more akin to sort of a tracheal occlusion model, but we've started leaving the perfluorocarbon to a meniscus, and we usually see that meniscus moving with simulated fetal breathing movements. 
> 
> Now, obviously they have an endo tracheal tube in their trachea. So it's not exactly the way it happens in nature, but they are moving that fluid. And, we've noted, and this is well known that lungs and a fetus need to be filled with fluid to stimulate normal growth and development.
> 
> ...
> 
> George Mychaliska, University of Michigan Healt [12:12:07]
> 
> The way we're envisioning clinical translation is twofold. 
> 
> One way would be on the first day of life. And that would be with a clinical risk stratification system where we would preemptively put infants at a high predicted mortality on the device. In that application, based on our animal work, we believe that fetal circulation would be reinitiated and there would be minimal barotrauma from the initial resuscitation.
> 
> The rescue mode, I think we can all acknowledge, we may not capture all of the patients on the first day of life. And clearly extremely premature infants die at various time points.
> 
> On the first day, maybe the most premature from respiratory failure. But then later in their course, they may exceed maximal medical management. So those patients could be placed on the artificial placenta, their lungs filled with perfluorocarbon to protect their lungs, and continue the maturation process. 
> 
> And I would acknowledge that fetal circulation likely would not be reinitiated, and there would be a greater degree of barotrauma. So this would be in my mind sort of extending what we think of conventional ECMO, to a more premature group of infants that definitely need it. 
> 
> And so that's why we also focused a lot of our work on developing non thrombogenic surfaces, because as we're all aware here, we typically don't provide ECMO for premature infants, even at 27, 28, 29 weeks.

> Robert Califf, FDA [00:00:54]
> 
> We have Brian King now as a new leader and a much invigorated effort in the enforcement side and some major federal rules that should get finished this year, that are in the hopper, one prohibiting menthol in cigarettes and another prohibiting flavored cigars. And then a really big one that would be a draft, which is limiting the amount of nicotine in cigarettes, which could have a major impact on the almost 500,000 Americans that die every year from tobacco related illness. 
> 
> I feel like always have to say that more than once. Because I think most people like me, when I first came to FDA in 2015, it just seemed like we had taken care of this problem. And, we all, I don't think there's anyone who believes that tobacco is not dangerous, or would argue about it causing illness. But, the fact is we still have millions of people using combustible tobacco, and now we have the threat of vaping affecting our teenagers in a major way. So a lot of work being done there in many ways.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:04:48]
> 
> We've taken a good, hard look at the clinical trials system. There's a Reagan Udall Foundation report about to come out. And I can't talk about exactly what's in the report, but what I will say is at least from my perspective, if we look at, medical product development, phase one, phase two, phase three, the sort of development phase, I think that goes really well. 
> 
> What, where we really have a gap, is after what happens at the end of phase three, these days, over half of our approvals are accelerated. And so we're putting things on the market with a lot of uncertainty about exactly and whom is this product most effective and how does it compare to other products? And what's the value in a health system spending $4.3 trillion a year, with the shortest life expectancy of any high income country now, and seeing a decline in life expectancy in this country. 
> 
> And so we need participation that's representative of the population at risk. And of course that means the traditional issues that we talk about with, race, ethnicity, sex, gender, but it also means age. And it means, where you live, one of the biggest factors evolving in the U.S. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:08:25]
> 
> We are the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. U.S. is 4% of the world's population. It's a global industry and we don't control what happens in other countries. 
> 
> And so when we look at our aggregate data, people have done a lot of talking about this, it doesn't look very representative of the United States, but we've just done a pretty major effort to segregate U.S. enrollment from non U.S. enrollment. 
> 
> And guess what? At least the initial look, even FDA regulated trials done by industry, U.S. enrollment looks pretty representative. It's getting there like the NIH has already done. I think that's a major achievement. 
> 
> Now it raises another question. What do we expect for a diversity in a global population? There are eight billion people in the world, and we're not the only country. So we're going to need to have discussions about what our expectations are for clinical trials, but at least we're straightening out, I think some misperceptions and always feel like we're slow on giving credit when people have done hard work and made progress.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:14:33]
> 
> We are learning more and more about misinformation. I hope your panel came up with some great ideas. I mean, the things we know we all need to do is every individual needs to spend time every day being aware that many of our friends and neighbors are living in information ecosystem which is dominated by views of science and medicine that are incorrect. And we also need to have humility that it's not like we have all the answers and that's not what science is about. 
> 
> So transmitting that we are dealing with uncertainty, we're making our best judgements, but there are areas where we've done the right studies. And we know for example, that vaccination prevents death from and hospitalization from COVID, that's just a fact. And, we need to be able to say that in a way that-- and embrace it after we've spent the time to be professionally adept at it. 
> 
> But what we also know is that individuals out there, the best way to correct misinformation is an interpersonal interaction. So it really will take a network of people.
> 
> At the government level, we are working hard to get better at saying things in plain language. 
> 
> Back in the good old days, when I used to interact with the FDA as a clinician, FDA made a lot of decisions. It wasn't necessarily a matter of public discussion. Now, every decision the FDA makes is a subject to 24 by 7 internet chatter from people who may have spent 10 seconds thinking about all the data and analysis that went into that decision.
> 
> So we got to explain what we do in plain language. And we have to be preemptive where possible, where we think something that's important for public health is gonna be attacked. 
> 
> I do want to emphasize, because it's a matter of recent court proceedings, in no way are we suppressing the right of other people to speak. The First Amendment is the First Amendment for a reason in the United States. And, where the line is about the old adage of you can't yell fire in the movie theater, where that line is related to public health has not been defined at this point. And so we have to be careful that we're not suppressing people's right to speak.
> 
> But I also think it's incumbent upon experts and knowledgeable people to counter information that's incorrect. That's out there. With the other point of view. 
> 
> But I would say, I've talked to all the experts I can find. I haven't found one yet that believes that we have the formula for moving this in the right direction. So we really gotta keep working on it.

## CDC webinar on "Preparing for the Upcoming Respiratory Virus Season"

- **Source:** Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity [webcast](https://emergency.cdc.gov/coca/calls/2023/callinfo_091923.asp) by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
- **Date:** broadcasted on September 19, 2023

> Question [00:53:58]
> 
> Is there any reason not to administer or coadminister vaccines together, such as decreased immune response or an increase in side effects?
> 
> Amadea Britton, CDC [00:54:23]
> 
> This is Dr. Britton. I can start to answer that question and happy to have Dr. Grohskopf or Dr. Wallace jump in as well. 
> 
> So, coadministration is obviously incredibly important. As I mentioned in my presentation, there is good data that RSV vaccines and influenza of vaccines can be co-administered safely, and that they generate non-inferior immune responses when they're given together. 
> 
> Just as you know, with administration of any two vaccines that may have some reactogenicity, that there can be additional side effects, if you give two vaccines together. And so if you have a patient for whatever reason, you're very concerned about having side effects, that could be something to discuss with them about whether they would want to space, but there's no requirement to space and it is acceptable to administer both RSV and influenza and COVID vaccines at the same visit, especially in patients that you think might have a difficult time coming back for additional visits or at very high risk of vaccine preventable disease. 
> 
> So I will let Dr. Grohskopf and Dr. Wallace add, if they have anything to add.
> 
> Lisa Grohskopf, CDC [00:55:40]
> 
> This is Lisa Grohskopf. I don't have much to add to that. 
> 
> There are also, for example, there's guidance concerning if you're giving, for example, two vaccines that might be more likely to cause a local reaction. Some vaccines, for example, the flu vaccines, the high dose and the adjuvanted, might be more likely to cause a local reaction at the site, to administer in general, give injectable vaccines at separate sites if they're given at the same time, but sometimes people will choose to say, if they have two vaccines, they're concerned about local reactions with giving them in two separate limbs.
> 
> Megan Wallace, CDC [00:56:16]
> 
> And this is Dr. Wallace. Nothing to add for me, as I said, in the presentation, you know, co-administration of vaccines sort of remains best practice. And so that's what we're recommending for COVID 19 vaccines.
> 
> But if you're planning to administer with an orthopoxvirus vaccine, we have some additional considerations that are in our clinical considerations guide.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:56:43]
> 
> Can you please discuss recommendations about vaccination administration following an active case of influenza, COVID 19, or RSV, and specifically wait times between being diagnosed with one of those diseases and then receiving the vaccination?
> 
> Lisa Grohskopf, CDC [00:57:04]
> 
> This is Lisa Grohskopf, I can take that with regard to flu. 
> 
> There isn't a specific wait time that's recommended. In general, for somebody who has a moderate to severe acute illness with or without fever, it's generally recommended that they've recovered from that illness and that that's something that's common across most vaccines and is in the general best practices guidelines for recommendation. 
> 
> There isn't a specific wait period beyond that. But in general, you'd want to wait, particularly if it was a moderate to severe acute illness, until recovery.
> 
> Megan Wallace, CDC [00:57:39]
> 
> And this is Dr. Wallace. I will add to that. 
> 
> So COVID is the same. We recommend that everyone wait until they're feeling better and sort of they meet the criteria for discontinuing isolation. 
> 
> But in addition, if they've recently had a SARS-CoV-2 infection, they can consider delaying their COVID vaccine by three months from its symptom onset. And that's just, we think that there's probably some protection still from the infection up to that point. So you can do that if you'd like.

## CDC webinar with testing laboratories on respiratory viruses

- **Date**: broadcasted September 18, 2023

> Manisha Patel, CDC [00:05:45]
> 
> Our early indicators, which are ED visits, test positivity and wastewater for COVID 19 are actually declining. So this is sort of the first week or two that we're seeing that, since this uptick that we were seeing before.
> 
> Our later indicators, hospital admissions, they do continue to increase, but at a lower rate than we were seeing in previous weeks. So that's good news, but again, none of us know for sure if that's going to be sustained. So we are continuing to closely monitor. 
> 
> And then for RSV, we're starting to see that increase in the Southeast. I'll show you some data from Florida, but still it's low nationally. 
> 
> And then the third point is influenza activity still remains low.
> 
> ...
> 
> Manisha Patel, CDC [00:11:13]
> 
> Here's some RSV data, again, nationally, not too much activity, but, if you look at the Southeast, you squint, you can start to see a little bit of an uptick in our RSV activity. This is NREVSS data, and then Florida, really pulls it out into suggest that they are starting to see RSV activity. 
> 
> And this is a normal geographic pattern, as many of you know, RSV starts in the Southeast and then spreads north and west. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Manisha Patel, CDC [00:12:47]
> 
> It's an interesting question about skewing, because I do think that you're right, that we don't fully know the burden of COVID 19 in the U.S., because not everyone has access to tests. And there's certainly a lot of changes that are happening behaviorally. People aren't necessarily always testing when they have COVID like symptoms, like maybe they used to do in the beginning of the pandemic. So there's a number of reasons that could be shifting. 
> 
> But I do think for this year, in the past couple of months, it's pretty consistent, because our data is coming for the lab testing data is coming from NREVSS, which are clinical laboratories that are submitting, so that data's not picking up home point of care tests and never actually did.
> 
> So appreciate the question. It's an important one, but I think we have enough information that the trends are interpretable and have been regular and interpretable in terms of the way the data is being submitted to CDC.
> 
> ...
> 
> Lydia Atherton, CDC [00:19:40]
> 
> Most of these, EG.5, FL.1.5.1, and the XBB's, those are all part of the F456L mutation grouping. 
> 
> So predictions for the next two weeks would be that there are going to be very few changes numerically from the last report. XBB.1.5 is projected to decrease in proportion nationally, about by 2% of cases. Many viruses still contain the identical or closely related spike protein sequence for that variant. 
> 
> And then for those lineages that encompass F456L, those are together, are comprising almost over 64% of viruses nationally. Within that group of variants, EG.5, which you can see here in yellow, that is the major component at around 25% and then HV.1, which you can see here in green, that's the fastest growing variant nationally and is predicted to comprise about 8% of cases. 
> 
> And then in terms of where we're looking geographically in the Nowcast, XBB.1.5 has dropped below 3% of cases in all regions. And as I mentioned, HV.1 currently has the highest growth rate in each region, with doubling times from 18 to 22 days. Just to give you a range, proportions in each region are predicted between 3% in-- and then up to 11% in the different regions. 
> 
> ...
> 
> David O'Connor, University of Wisconsin-Madison [00:23:11]
> 
> We're going to talk today about indoor air sampling for respiratory viruses. And this has several advantages, some of which are obvious and others, a bit less. So, it's very cost effective to sample an indoor space, such as a school cafeteria, an unhoused shelter, an emergency room, for respiratory viruses in the air. It's also anonymous to the individuals who are contributing viruses that are detected in the air. And of course, as was alluded to earlier, it's resilient to individual testing behavior. 
> 
> The type of air sampling we're talking about today uses a Thermo Fisher aerosol sense air detection instrument. This is a versatile and portable instrument that can be deployed immediately to new settings and has very simple ease of operations, such that in some of our schools, we have like fifth and sixth graders who are responsible for changing the air cartridges a couple of times a week. 
> 
> So we have explored a variety of different types of use cases for indoor air sampling for viruses. Our-- we got started using it as a way of monitoring virus transmission within and between communities. One example of this is doing K through 12 school monitoring for pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza and RSV as a way of understanding community risk. 
> 
> We can also use the same technology as an early warning system for looking at settings that are at high risk for consequential outbreaks. So for example, we have a couple of air samplers running in a complex care long-term care facility.
> 
> And finally it could be used to identify novel virus threats. An example of this would be using this technology in international airports to look at the introduction of viruses of concern. 
> 
> ...
> 
> David O'Connor, University of Wisconsin-Madison [00:33:13]
> 
> We're working with Gingko Concentric to incorporate air sampling into the CDCs traveler genomic surveillance program. 
> 
> I'm sure some of you on the call are familiar with this and, might be aware of this as something that's coming soon.
> 
> We're working to increase the sensitivity, cost, and throughput of viral metogenomics so that we can make this a more reliable first readout of what's present in an air sample. 
> 
> We're looking to make the detection itself faster by introducing point of source testing, as well as improving high throughput multiplex detection to be lower cost and faster. 
> 
> We're also working with a different type of air sampler to recover live virus so that we can also study infectivity as well as the presence of viral RNA.
>
> ...
>
> 
> David O'Connor, University of Wisconsin-Madison [00:36:18]
> 
> So going back a couple of years ago, my understanding is that the cue branch has worked with Ginkgo Concentric and what was formerly known as XpresSpa to do pooled PCR testing of arriving international travelers at a variety of international airports. So that's been ongoing for a while. So when people arrive, they can opt into contributing a a nasal swab at a kiosk. They then get pooled and brought back into the lab for PCR testing and sequencing.

> We're looking to put the air samplers at those same kiosk locations, so that while people are registering for participation in pooled PCR testing, we will also be sampling the air at the same time, to see if we're able to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the air and determine what genotypes of SARS-Cov-2 are in those samples.

## NIAID officials on draft DURC and P3CO policy changes

- **Source:** [webcasts](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/niaid-council-agenda) of a National Advisory Allergy and Infectious Diseases Council meeting
- **Date:** broadcasted September 11, 2023

> Hugh Auchincloss, NIAID [00:16:16]
> 
> There is also an RFI out to comment about some questions that are posed about the revision of our DURC and P3CO oversight policies. 
> 
> The actual RFI put several questions out there to you. It does not include the draft of the proposed revisions, but I can tell you a summary of those, DURC, that's Dual Use Research of Concern, used to up until now involve 15 pathogens and 7 deadly sins, as we called them. P3CO, that's pathogens of pandemic potential, that's the three P's, care and oversight, C O, okay? That has been modified in the draft form where it used to be. 
> 
> We would worry about enhanced pathogens of potential pandemic potential, if there was a high likelihood of increased transmissibility and high likelihood of increased virulence.
> 
> The new draft guidelines says moderate likelihood of enhanced transmissibility or moderate likelihood of enhanced virulence.
> 
> I think these are worth commenting on. They are going to have, I think, a very significant impact on how we oversight, how we do oversight for this kind of research. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Emily Erbelding, NIAID [00:13:05]
> 
> There's a request for information published last week on changes to the policies for the oversight of Dual Use Research of Concern known as DURC, and also Potential Pandemic Pathogen Care and Oversight, the P3CO policy framework. 
> 
> This is the effort to revise these these policies was primarily under the-- it was the responsibility assigned to the Office of Science and Technology, the OSTP, in out of the White House and also the National Security Council.
> 
> The proposed policy will actually expand pretty significantly the amount of the number of pathogens that have to be on the DURC watch list. This is my read of the draft policy. 
> 
> Now, the draft policy isn't published in this federal guidance, or in the federal registry, but a lot of questions on areas of that might be unclear or might be difficult to implement, are targeted questions are asked. And so by October 16th, OSTP and the National Security Council would like to get input from the scientific community, people that are involved in biosafety, at the institutional level, and also investigators who work with some of these pathogens to get input on how this policy, the draft policy, maybe could be improved to make it workable in the future. 
> 
> So that's out there, it's important. If you don't think that you're a stakeholder, your institutional biosafety committee might want to be, you might want to point them to this RFI. So that the policy that comes out on the other side to be implemented next year might is the best in terms of biosecurity, bio safety, and supports the best science.

## CDC officials and NCHS BSC members at meeting

- **Source:** [webcast](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/bsc/bsc_meetings.htm) of a Board of Scientific Counselors, National Center for Health Statistics meeting
- **Date:** broadcasted September 14, 2023

> Brian Moyer, CDC [11:15:58]
> 
> Based on my personal conversations with Dr. Cohen, she is a big supporter of data and a big supporter of NCHS. And, while she's bringing her own priorities to CDC, she's also carefully building on the many efforts that are already underway across the across the agency. And she's referring to this as no sharp turns. 
> 
> Next slide, please. 
> 
> As we discussed at our last meeting, there is a new initiative underway at CDC and it's called the CDC Moving Forward initiative. And, as we discussed, the idea is to improve CDC by building on what's working well and addressing opportunities for improvement, where they exist and, sort of in that spirit, in Mandy's spirit of no sharp turns, we and all the other centers across CDC remain committed to this CDC Moving Forward initiative.
>
> ...
>
> 
> Jennifer Layden, CDC [11:33:22]
> 
> Around Dr. Cohen's priorities, we're very excited that data technology is of high priority to her. There are three kind of core focus areas that she's identified. One of them is the readiness and execution for the fall and winter respiratory illnesses, the second around mental health and combating opioid crisis, and then the third supporting young families. 
> 
> We are working really across all three of these. Just to speak to a couple of them. 
> 
> One is in the space of the fall readiness. So ensuring we're doing what we can, in the anticipation of COVID, flu, RSV, and other respiratory pathogens, our office is leading the effort to find and visualize and disseminate the data out to the public for the fall surge. 
> 
> So really emphasizing importance of a coordinated, integrated approach, across the agency, to meet our mission. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Brian Moyer, CDC [11:38:39]
> 
> Looking forward just a bit, the 2023 America's Children report will be available on September 27. And as you know, this report is coordinated by NCHS, but reflects collaboration across 23 federal agencies. So it's quite the collaborative effort. 
> 
> This slide highlights some of the key findings from this year's report. So, please feel free to check that out when it becomes available on the 27th. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Amy Brown, CDC [02:48:16]
> 
> So we're going to be able to collect two rounds of the survey for this year, from July to September, and then from October to December. It's taking us a little bit of time to set up the approvals in the processes. But we expect we're going to be in a full quarterly data collection schedule, next year in 2024. So each round is going to have at least 4,000 total respondents, which represent completed surveys, drawn from nationally representative samples.
> 
> A minimum of 2,000 is going to come from each of two commercial online panels that will collect data simultaneously, versus the KnowledgePanel, from Ipsos Public Affairs and AmeriSpeak from NORC at the University of Chicago. These are two of the largest panels in the industry. 
> 
> Our goal is to achieve a faster turnaround time for the release of data compared to our NCHS core surveys. So once all the operational processes are in place, it should take about six months from the time we receive sponsored content to release data on national estimates.
> 
> ...
> 
> Amy Brown, CDC [02:49:44]
> 
> Sponsored content must address at least three, these three priority areas, as shown here. The first being time sensitive data needs, areas where existing statistical resources are unavailable, not timely or of insufficient or unknown quality. 
> 
> The second measuring public health attitudes and behaviors, cases where things are changing very quickly.
> 
> And the last being development work, which provides agencies an ability to do some developmental work, areas where their concepts are less clear or evolving, or they want to do some measurement that can inform future question design. 
> 
> The guidance also describes the type of estimates that the rapid surveys are not well suited for. And these are things like estimates that are already produced by our cross sectional surveys, our core surveys, because this is not meant to be a replacement for those, low prevalence estimates, or estimates for hard to reach or low prevalence subpopulations. So we're very clear, upfront, before we receive proposals from provider potential sponsors.
> 
> ...
> 
> Amy Brown, CDC [02:50:53]
> 
> This slide shows a few examples of the wide range of sponsor topics and it really is a wide range that we've received, that we've included on our first round. They were submitted from a variety of different CDC centers, institutes and offices. These include chronic illness from long COVID, household use of two air quality products, HEPA filters in air purifiers, several different types of cancer risk topics, including genetic tests, sunscreen use and carcinogens and hair products,  and exposure to intimate partner violence. 
> 
> Next slide.
> 
> We've also partnered on this first round with OMB's interagency technical working group on race and ethnicity standards. We're helping them to test some alternative wording for proposed standard race and ethnicity questions. So in addition to our CDC partners, we also have one external partner, OMB as well. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Amy Brown, CDC [02:51:48]
> 
> And I'll just conclude by saying that the initial data release from this first round is expected sometime this coming winter.
> 
> Data's is going to be released on a variety of formats, including an online interactive dashboard set of web tables and restricted and public use data files. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Amy Brown, CDC [02:53:16]
> 
> I think that when-- there has been a great of great level of interest. We put out a-- we have a form to send an announcement out to all of the CDC centers and institutes. And we received very good attendance at a webinar to get some basic information. And then that was followed pretty quickly with a number of proposals. 
> 
> And they really were a range of topics kind of all over the place. Because it's a good a good opportunity to be able to-- particularly if there's some topics where they wanted do some development work, question design, this is a unique opportunity to be able to field that and get data back in a relatively for us timely manner.
> 
> ...
> 
> Adena Galinsky, CDC [03:01:00]
> 
> This challenge has only gotten harder as you know, and has been particularly hard for NHIS FR's as anti-government and anti CDC hostility has increased. 
> 
> Second, they asked for more help overcoming overcoming access barriers to sampled addresses such as gated communities, locked buildings, video doorbells. In other words, a way to get a message over the castle wall, and convince the residents to lower the draw bridge down over the moat. 
> 
> Third, there was a clear need for morale boosts, given the increased emotional labor demands of the FR job and the post COVID pandemic exhaustion and disconnection that so many of us have been facing, FR morale is pretty low. So this likely translates to higher FR attrition and training costs and lower response rates. So the FR's asked for more encouragement, gratitude, and celebration of successes and more paid opportunities to connect with and get help from other FR's and FS's to power their work and lift their spirits. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Adena Galinsky, CDC [03:05:47]
> 
> The third initiative is a project to encourage and help more FR's use the handwritten note technique that some FR's developed and described to us. So when used correctly, the FR's who pioneered it report, it can help FR's contact respondents behind access barriers and convert reluctant respondents. 
> 
> So we've created a new piece of stationary, the blank NHIS note card, whose front and back are shown here, that the FR's can use for these notes and a motivational training module. And, we're working on a printed job aid with sample note text adapted from real notes provided by the FR's, to make the process of writing these notes easier. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Andy Peytchev, NCHS BSC [03:12:41]
> 
> On your more direct question about any negative sentiment against CDC, it can go both ways. It just depends on the person. And so varying, that seems like an intriguing idea. To what degree do you emphasize CDC versus Census Bureau and vice versa? I expect that all the FR's are carrying census bureau badges, and that should be working to your advantage if that's the concern.
> 
> Adena Galinsky, CDC [03:13:06]
> 
> Yes. And that is, that is something that certainly the more experienced FR's did talk about that, about getting a sense for what to highlight, what to bring up, what to downplay, and it's right. It's something that right, you can't know in advance. Exactly. But sometimes that it certainly is helpful to focus on the Census Bureau affiliation.
> 
> ...
> 
> Alan Simon, CDC [03:17:30]
> 
> What's going to be in the survey? It's all the usual suspects, but some things, some new things and things were bringing back after some time. 
> 
> So anthropometry or body measures, dental exams, labs, blood urine, we're bringing genetics back for the first time in a long time, which is exciting. 
> 
> Blood pressure, we'd hope to have three to seven year olds in there, which would be new and great work, but we found in our pilot testing that it didn't go quite as smoothly as we'd hoped, so we really need some more pilot testing before we hit the field in a big way with blood pressure for that young age group.
> 
> Vision, hearing, DEX exams, spirometry is coming back after a while being out, nasal microbiome is new and exciting, dietary recall of course, one of the major reasons that we do NHANES, of course. 
> 
> And I, I realized after I made the slides that, I forgot to add that medications are coming back too. Which is a sort of widely used part of NHANES. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Alan Simon, CDC [03:15:21]
> 
> It's fundamentally the same in that it's still a population based survey with in-home interviews and then bringing people out to mobile examination centers. That part isn't gonna change. Next slide? 
> 
> But of course we are updating some things and making, hopefully, making some improvements. Next slide?
> 
> So one of the major changes is that we'll be sunsetting the trailers that you see on the right. Not only because they're getting old and worn out, but also we're moving to trucks. That's not actually the truck on the left, but it's a very old truck, so I thought it was kind of representative. 
> 
> The idea is that a mobile examination center will now be a set of three trucks. And why are we doing this? The trucks are more nimble. They can set up and be torn down much quicker. That's going to allow us to be in more than one location within a primary sampling unit. I think that's going to allow us to move around a little bit and get closer to our respondents, hopefully increase our response rate. They also have a smaller footprint allowing us to maybe set up in places that we couldn't previously.
> 
> Other improvements are we're going to more primary sampling units in the U.S. each year. We're increasing from 15 to 20. We had hoped it was gonna be 30, but it looks like that's not going to be feasible. So we are increasing to 20 that still provides some improvement over where we were. It's still 5,000 participants a year. We're just spreading them out over more areas. 
> 
> We're changing from our primary sampling unit of counties to public use micro data areas or PUMAs that Census creates. These are more standard across geography, in terms of population size. And this actually provides more statistical power. We're also going to decrease the number of participants in each household that we go to. Again, the idea is you spread out the sample more, and that provides you with better power than we than we have now, hopefully allowing us to create estimates for slightly smaller groups than before.

- **Date:** broadcasted September 14, 2023

> Hanna Kirking, CDC [00:13:51]
> 
> Right now, in the U.S., we started to see a rise in COVID 19 cases and then hospitalizations in late June and throughout mid-July, and where we're at today in terms of the trends with where we're going, is right now nationwide kind of test positivity seems like it maybe has now plateaued at kind of a potential early peak. ED visits are plateaued and hospital admissions are going up. And again, this pattern should be interpreted, realizing that we expect a slight time shift with these. 
> 
> Here you can see there's slight different patterns in different regions, but overall that's the, the nationwide trend. 
> 
> So next slide? This slide just shows the overall epi curve of hospitalizations throughout much of the pandemic. The hospitalization numbers are shown in the blue bars and these are weekly counts. The superimposed orange line is actually proportion test positive, and that one is using the Y axis on the right. And so you can kind of see the yellowish orange line relative to hospitalizations is back shifted a little bit to the left. And that reflects that difference that I was talking about. 
> 
> Also in this slide, you can see kind of hospitalizations is still kind of on the upswing it seems like, realizing that there's a reporting delay. But we're starting to be hopeful that we may be peaking in terms of proportion positive. That's a guarded hope, but it's there nonetheless, just based on kind of curve and overall patterns. 
> 
> Next slide, one more please? 
> 
> All right. This curve shows percentage of emergency department visits where COVID 19 is diagnosed and it's separated out by age. So the Y axis is the percent of the emergency department visits. The X axis is date or week. You can see here, I think the big takeaway here, also is that in a couple age groups, we're starting to see the peak kind of leveling off. 
> 
> And again, that's kind of integrating various data with hopes that we might be reaching the peak of this increase we've seen the last couple months. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Keipp Talbot, ACIP [00:41:20]
> 
> Bye bye booster. We are no longer giving boosters and it's going to be very difficult to stop using that word because that word has become pervasive. 
> 
> We are currently giving the updated 2023-2024 vaccine. 
> 
> We are beginning to think of COVID like influenza. Influenza changes each year, and we give a new vaccine for each year. We don't boost each year. So it's going to be difficult to start changing that terminology, but it is no longer a booster. It is now the current vaccine for the year. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Amadea Britton, CDC [01:26:35]
> 
> I can speak to the adults. And this is a critical concern. And I saw a lot of questions about it, where some of this is a little bit beyond the scope of CDC, unfortunately, a little bit hemmed in by what's happening across the board. 
> 
> But what I can say is that these vaccines are covered under Medicare Part D, which means they, because of the changes with the Inflation Reduction Act in January of 2023, they should have zero cost sharing under Medicare Part D. 
> 
> That doesn't address the issue of people that don't have the Part D coverage. But, if you do have Part D they, regardless of the fact that they are prescribed under shared clinical decision making, they are covered with zero cost sharing. 
> 
> In terms of private insurers under the ACA, they also are required to cover this, despite it being shared clinical decision making, because it will be on the adult immunization schedule. I know there have been some hiccups with that because that requires separate approval by ACIP. But we have tried to address that. And, we are definitely working with our other federal partners. 
> 
> We have a banner up now on the website that basically says, this is part of the adult immunization schedule, even if it's not on the actual chart yet. 
> 
> But the one other thing there for providers to know is that even though it will be covered eventually without cost sharing by private insurers, they have up to a year from the recommendation to add it to their plan. So that's part of what we're seeing too. 
> 
> So I think the good news is in the long term, we expect coverage for the adults to be very good. But, the-- right now, as we're kind of in this introductory period, it definitely is challenging. And we understand it's a huge equity issue, and we're definitely trying to work on it, and I will turn it over perhaps to Jefferson to talk about VFC.
> 
> Jefferson Jones, CDC [01:28:32]
> 
> So VFC, nirsevimab was voted to be included through resolution at ACIP in VFC. And we are expecting by the end or next month for those contract negotiations-- I mean, it's a goal, for those to be completed for VFC.
> 
> On the private insurance side, there is a lot more uncertainty we've heard about. Most inpatient hospitals are not VFC enrolled. And, we know tha bundled payments are an issue for nirsevimab. And then on the outpatient side, same as through ACA, it is required to be covered, but there is a potential lag for private insurance, as they have up to a year. And we have heard different timing based on different healthcare systems. 
> 
> So unfortunately there's not a easy answer to those questions, but we are working closely with AAP and with our liaisons from the insurance industry to ACIP to try and do, frankly, it's just as, as best we can for a brand new product monoclonal antibody, this is a brand new class to be used this way, which is leading to a lot of implementation challenges, which are unfortunate, but at least we're excited that we do have this product included in ACIP recommendations.

## FDA spokesperson on whether new COVID shots are "boosters"

- **Source:** email from an FDA spokesperson
- **Date:** received September 14, 2023

## FDA spokesperson on status of oral phenylephrine after meeting

- **Source:** email from Cherie Duvall-Jones of the Food and Drug Administration
- **Date:** received September 13, 2023

> If the FDA determines that oral phenylephrine is no longer considered generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) under the conditions of use in OTC Monograph M012: Cold, Cough, Allergy, Bronchodilator, and Antiasthmatic Drug Products for OTC Human Use (OTC Monograph M012), the FDA would issue a proposed order to amend OTC Monograph M012by removing oral phenylephrine as a GRASE active ingredient from that monograph. Stakeholders would have the opportunity to comment on the proposed order, including by providing additional data. During this time period, the marketing status of oral phenylephrine would not change. After considering all of the comments on the proposed order, the FDA would issue a final order on the GRASE status of oral phenylephrine for use as a nasal decongestant under the conditions of use in OTC Monograph M012.
> 
> The FDA has no further information to provide at this time regarding the timing of any decision the agency may make following the advisory committee meeting.

## FDA officials and NDAC meeting participants on oral phenylephrine

- **Source:** [webcast](https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/updated-september-11-12-2023-meeting-nonprescription-drugs-advisory-committee-meeting-announcement) of Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee meeting
- **Date:** broadcasted September 11-12, 2023

> Theresa Michele, FDA [00:46:19]
> 
> The main objective of today's meeting is to discuss the efficacy of oral phenylephrine as a nasal decongestant. We will be including data that have become available since the committee last discussed this back in 2007. We're also asking you to consider the potential safety and efficacy of higher than monograph doses of oral phenylephrine.
> 
> ...
> 
> Theresa Michele, FDA [00:46:45]
> 
> Now, as you all know, phenylephrine is a very old drug. It's been marketed for more than 75 years for a variety of uses and via a variety of different roots of administration. Anytime a product's been on the market for that long it's human nature to make assumptions about what we think we know about the product for the purposes of today's meeting.
> 
> We're asking you to put aside those assumptions and help us think critically about the data at hand, and in particular, what the data may or may not show.
> 
> ...
> 
> Theresa Michele, FDA [00:50:44]
> 
> It's not uncommon that we learn additional information about drugs that have been on the market for some time. And phenylephrine is no exception.
>  <br><br>Some of the additional data was brought forward in two citizens petitions, one in 2007 and one in 2015. The 2007 citizens petition requested that the agency amend the dosages of both oral phenylephrine salts by increasing the maximum allowed dosage for patients 12 years of age and older. It also requested that FDA withdraw approval, or rather make it not GRASE, for use in children less than 12 years of age.
>  <br><br>The 2015 citizens petition requested that FDA reclassify the oral phenylephrine salts as not GRASE due to lack of efficacy.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Theresa Michele, FDA [00:51:48]
>  <br><br>Because of the additional data that had become available since FDA's GRASE finding back in 1994, we convened an advisory committee in 2007 to discuss the safety and effectiveness of oral phenylephrine as a nasal decongestant.
>  <br><br>At the meeting in 2007, the committee also considered the original studies supporting the effectiveness of oral phenylephrine. The committee noted that the results are not consistent across studies for nasal airway resistance and recommended that symptoms should be the essential primary endpoint. They also noted that evidence of efficacy consisted primarily of studies conducted 40 years ago, which is now 55 years ago. And it included fewer than 200 subjects who received oral phenylephrine 10 milligrams.
>  <br><br>Due to the small size of the studies, they felt that near nasal airway resistance results may not be generalizable to a wider population. Based on this, the committee recommended that additional data be conducted, specifically, multicenter parallel, randomized, double blind placebo controlled trials, preferably with an active control, such as pseudoephedrine, to evaluate nasal congestion scores and symptom relief. They also recommended characterization of the phenylephrine dose response and dosing interval, comparison of the PK of single ingredient products versus multiple ingredient products, and a safety evaluation of the effects of phenylephrine on blood pressure.
>  <br><br>I'm pleased to say that we now have much of the data that was requested by the 2007 advisory committee. And we are now bringing this back to this committee for consideration.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Theresa Michele, FDA [00:55:54]
>  <br><br>An advisory committee is utilized to conduct public hearings on matters of importance that come before FDA to review the issues involved and to provide advice and recommendations to the commissioner. The commissioner has sole discretion concerning action to be taken and policy to be expressed on any matter considered by an advisory committee.
>  <br><br>Now, as such, we are not asking you to make a GRASE determination today on phenylephrine as an oral decongestant. Rather, we are asking you to advise us on what you believe the data show in terms of effectiveness.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Ben Bishop, FDA [00:57:43]
>  <br><br>Although the agency first took regulatory action in 1976, this action was based on the conclusions and recommendations of an advisory review panel, which was convened in November of 1972.
>  <br><br>Not to be confused with other types of panels or advisory committees, that panel and others like it are known as DESI review panels. DESI stands for drug efficacy study implementation, and the DESI panels represented one of the agency's pivotal first steps in a long process of rulemaking.
>  <br><br>Almost 20 years later, the final monograph for nasal decongestants, part of the larger cold cough allergy bronchodilator and anti asthmatic monograph, was published in 1994.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Ben Bishop, FDA [00:59:00]
>  <br><br>In 1962, a retrospective evaluation of drug efficacy was authorized by the Kefauver-Harris amendment. Notably, the law mandated that FDA evaluate effectiveness, whereas previous approvals had required only a determination of safety.
>  <br><br>For non-prescription drugs, the drug efficacy study implementation or DESI review, began 10 years later when FDA assembled a list of over 400 active ingredients being marketed without a prescription and categorized them into 26 therapeutic categories. One of these became known as the cold cough allergy bronchodilator and anti asthma monograph, or CCABA monograph, and this included nasal decongestants.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Tracy Pham, FDA [02:46:38]
>  <br><br>Phenylephrine had higher proportions of manufacturer and retail sales than pseudoephedrine. Since 2018, phenylephrine accounted for the majority of retail sales in both bottle and packages, and in sale dollars.
>  <br><br>Retail sales of phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine decreased from 2018 to 2021, before increasing in 2022.
>  <br><br>In 2022, phenylephrine retail sales represented 1.8 billion dollars, compared to half a billion dollars of pseudoephedrine retail sales.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Marcia Howard, CHPA [04:32:58]
>  <br><br>Phenylephrine has played an important role in consumer's temporary self-treatment of nasal congestion. It is the only available oral non-prescription medicine for nasal congestion that is sold without having to show an ID or to complete a log book.
>  <br><br>Oral phenylephrine comes in both brand name and store brand versions. Nasal congestion is one of the most bothersome symptoms associated with colds and upper respiratory allergies and is linked to decreased work productivity and quality of life and to sleep disturbances.
>  <br><br>Consumer satisfaction with oral phenylephrine is high. According to household panel data, half of American households rely on phenylephrine and over two thirds of these households chose to repurchase the medicines on average four times over the year, which is a strong indication of satisfaction.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Marcia Howard, CHPA [04:32:58]
>  <br><br>Phenylephrine has played an important role in consumer's temporary self-treatment of nasal congestion. It is the only available oral non-prescription medicine for nasal congestion that is sold without having to show an ID or to complete a log book.

>  <br><br>Marcia Howard, CHPA [04:40:34]
>  <br><br>Our position is that this is a safe and effective medicine and its removal will result in increased demand for pseudoephedrine and a shortage of FDA approved on shelf medications. It would have supply chain implications and would cause an increased burden on the consumers we serve and on the healthcare system.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>David Spangler, CHPA [06:12:32]
>  <br><br>If you do want to change to pseudoephedrine, one, you would need to be already licensed with DEA. If not, you'd have to be applying, have to institute certain security controls, compliance with state law requirements. 
>  <br><br>Then you would have to request your quota, request sgo in in the spring, manufacturing in May, procurement in April, you then get your quota, then some months later, and then as a practical matter of the retail level, typically they're doing their planograms, what the store is going to look like, those get adjusted in the spring, and then implemented typically in the fall in most major retailers.
>  <br><br>So you get a significant lag. Plus, as Dr. Howard mentioned, there's a limit on the number of products that a retailer would be willing to carry behind the counter because of limited space.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Theresa Michele, FDA [07:44:34]
>  <br><br>The thing that matters when you are dosing, a drug is how much of the drug gets to where it needs to be, and whether it is a high enough concentration to affect the receptor that it's trying to affect to make the change.
>  <br><br>So in this case, we need the drug to get to the alpha receptors in the nose so that they can constrict the blood vessels and reduce the amount of congestion. So the actual amount that's absorbed is somewhat irrelevant. What we really care about is the fact that the concentration that affects the receptors is higher than the concentration that you can get into your body, because it's extensively metabolized by the intestine.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Yunzhao Ren, FDA [07:45:48]
>  <br><br>As a pharmacologist, we believe if a drug works, that means it should work at the site where it's working for nasal congestion. You should, we believe that how the drug work at the nasal congestion is at the nasal mucosa, the amount or the concentration of the drug, let's say following oral administration, should reach certain level to be efficacious or at least as potent as those animal studies, cellular studies, molecular studies indicating that concentration should work.
>  <br><br>And the results show that, following the oral administration route, the amount of the phenylephrine, or the concentration of phenylephrine, failed to reach that threshold concentration, from the in vitro or cellular level.
>  <br><br>There's a concern raised in the morning by saying, 'hey, phenylephrine has a very wide distribution, tissue distribution, which means when phenylephrine entered the human body, there could be some other organs which can absorb this phenylephrine, so that it can be enriched in certain organs— I shouldn't use enrich, but distribute to those organs and bind to something.
>  <br><br>But there's no evidence to showing that the nasal mucosa, this tissue, can enrich, the phenylephrine amount of concentration at that local site.
>  <br><br>And in addition as a pharmacologist, we believe that how this phenylephrine works is through adrenergic receptor, which is located in the blood vessels. And therefore in this scenario, the tissue distribution— I mean, let's— the organ concentration, or irrelevant tissue distribution concentration, doesn't matter here. What matters here is the blood concentration, the plasma concentration.
>  <br><br>So we do measure, everyone here in this field measured plasma concentration, and it's lower than EC 50 value.
>  <br><br>So that's why, from a pharmacology perspective, we can provide these evidence to support or explain the lack of efficacy from the clinical trials.
>  <br><br>
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>
>  <br><br>Martha Lenhart, FDA [00:44:23]
>  <br><br>For clarification, three voting questions were posed at the 2007 NDAC.
>  <br><br>For the first voting question, the advisory committee disagreed with the statement that phenylephrine in a 10 milligram immediate release formulation has been shown to be effective when dosed every four hours for the symptomatic treatment of nasal congestion and that no additional studies are needed to support its effectiveness. In other words, did it meet GRASE standards? Two voted yes. 10 voted no.
>  <br><br>The second question was worded. Given the available data that exists, the evidence is supportive that the 10 milligram immediate release formulation may be effective. 11 voted yes, one voted no.
>  <br><br>And the third question asked, whether additional studies are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of higher doses. Nine voted yes, three voted no.
>  <br><br>In conclusion, the committee recommended that additional trials be conducted, specifically multi-center parallel randomized blinded placebo controlled trials, preferably with an active control to evaluate nasal congestion scores and symptom relief.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Martha Lenhart, FDA [00:45:49]
>  <br><br>Since the 2007 NDAC, more data had become available. Next slide, please.
>  <br><br>Certain clinical pharmacology information presented yesterday by Dr. Ren was not available to the 1970s DESI panel. This includes that only parent phenylephrine, not its metabolites, is active.
>  <br><br>We note discussion yesterday about the bioavailability of phenylephrine.
>  <br><br>Due to the extensive first pass mechanism, only a fraction of the orally administered dose is present as parent phenylephrine in the systemic circulation, the Cmax value of parent phenylephrine following an oral dose of 10 milligrams is low. About one nanogram per mL.
>  <br><br>One nanogram per mL is approximately one third of the in vitro alpha one adrenergic EC 50 value because the blood vessel is the target organ and the site of action for parent phenylephrine. The plasma concentration of parent phenylephrine is clinically relevant.
>  <br><br>This peak plasma concentration is unlikely to achieve a pharmacologic effect in the nasal mucosa needed for nasal decongestant. Both the PK and PD data suggests that a much higher dose of oral phenylephrine may be needed to achieve a nasal decongestant effect.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Martha Lenhart, FDA [00:47:51]
>  <br><br>The original efficacy studies conducted prior to the 2007 NDAC do not meet today's trial design standards. For example, clinical and statistical methodology issues of these studies included small study sizes that limit generalizability and inconsistent results across early studies suggesting possible data integrity issues, and of primary importance, the use of unvalidated nasal airway resistance or NAR for efficacy assessments.
>  <br><br>In contrast to NAR, nasal symptom scores are the gold standard as an endpoint because they directly measure the symptom of interest. Every drug approved over the past 30 years in the cough cold allergy space have demonstrated to be effective based on nasal symptom scores.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Martha Lenhart, FDA [00:49:22]
>  <br><br>More recent studies consisting of multicenter parallel, randomized blinded placebo controlled trials also showed that a 10 milligram dose of phenylephrine was not significantly different from placebo.
>  <br><br>In summary, the new data appear compelling that the monograph dose of oral phenylephrine results in no meaningful systemic exposure and no evidence of efficacy.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>William Figg, NIH [00:55:52]
>  <br><br>Second, there was a lot of trying to confuse things yesterday, in my opinion, for CHPA's discussion about metabolites.
>  <br><br>First pass metabolism does not result in the parent drug being in the systemic circulation and bioavailability is really only the parent drug in the circulation, so that 1% is accurate or close to it.
>  <br><br>So, both of those points suggest the concentration of phenylephrine being achieved in the circulation is substantially low.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Maria Coyle, NDAC [01:28:12]
>  <br><br>If I were to do a short summary of what we have discussed to this point, I think several panel members have mentioned that they do believe that the concentration of drug, of parent drug, that is actually reaching the tissue in the nasal passages is low.
>  <br><br>That overall the later studies do seem to provide some strong evidence that the phenylephrine at 10 milligrams may not be effective, is likely not to effective in relieving nasal congestion, at least in the population studied.
>  <br><br>That there seems to be some agreement that the populations of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and those patients with cold symptoms may may overlap. And so not an unreasonable study population for those later trials, as well as some clinical context around what might be, most of what might be considered an effective treatment and how that effectiveness might be assessed.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Mark Dykewicz, NDAC [01:32:55]
>  <br><br>In practice, the major potential complication of uncontrolled nasal obstruction might be the development of bacterial sinus infections. That doesn't happen very often, but if you are looking at trying to maintain the patency or the openness between the inside of the nose and the sinus cavities to avoid mucus accumulation and possible development of a bacterial sinus infection, you certainly would want to achieve that or try to achieve that with an effective treatment. And oral phenylephrine is not going to do it.
>  <br><br>So, there would be alternatives, such as intranasal decongestant sprays that for short term might work better. It would be off label. One might consider a nasal corticosteroid to help reduce congestion swelling within the nose.
>  <br><br>But I think, um, are there clear cut studies that would prove that some of these alternative treatments are reducing the risk of developing bacterial sinusitis with the need for antibiotics and potential other complications? We don't have studies that clearly demonstrate that.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Maria Coyle, NDAC [02:16:26]
>  <br><br>So question two for our vote, do the current scientific data that were presented support that the monograph dosage of orally administered phenylephrine is effective as a nasal decongestant?
>  <br><br>If yes, discuss what data you consider supportive, if no discuss what additional data, if any, are needed to assess phenylephrine pharmacokinetics or efficacy.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Jessica Seo, FDA
>  <br><br>[02:24:28]
>  <br><br>There were 0 yes's, 16 no's, and 0 abstentions.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Maria Coyle, NDAC [02:36:48]
>  <br><br>I also voted no, for all the reasons stated.
>  <br><br>I think we, we clearly have better options in the over the counter space to help our patients. And the studies do not support that this is an effective drug and delaying care or other negatives associated with care far outweigh you know, any potential, even in the future, if this drug were at different doses.
>  <br><br>So I would not be in favor of additional studies at this time, along with my fellow panel panelists, who stated the same.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Karim Calis, NDAC [02:40:26]
>  <br><br>We already know how this drug works. We already know its mechanism action. We already know what this class of drugs does. We just know that in its current form, in the dosage form that is currently provided at the current dosage, that you don't. You have very low systemic exposure.
>  <br><br>So, if we push the dose, it's possible that you might get additional systemic exposure. But with that, we already know that we will probably very likely encounter additional cardiovascular effects, just as we would do from the entire class of those drugs.
>  <br><br>So I think that would be the, the wrong thing. And I don't think that the data would support that.
>  <br><br>Could there be some efficacy at much higher dosage, possibly? But with the corresponding increase in potential cardiovascular effects and safety issues.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Maria Coyle, NDAC [02:48:36]
>  <br><br>I'm hearing a broad consensus that the advisory committee members do not necessarily support a higher dosage be explored for OTC use.
>  <br><br>...
>  <br><br>Maria Coyle, NDAC [03:04:27]
>  <br><br>I just want to summarize what we've heard thus far.
>  <br><br>I think concern that any change in status for OTC phenylephrine be communicated clearly that, the public be reassured as to a lack of effectiveness or a lack of efficacy as the driver for this change, rather than safety concerns.
>  <br><br>I think recognizing that some patients may be very in tune to the ingredients of their OTC products and may be very concerned that this product is not going to potentially be available. And maybe on the flip side, patients who are less in tune with the individual ingredients and may in fact not even be able to discern a difference.
>  <br><br>I think also recognizing that we've been discussing sort of maybe an assumption that phenylephrine would be withdrawn from the monograph, while I want to acknowledge that that's not really what we have voted on, per se. And so the FDA will have to make that determination.
>  <br><br>But regardless, I do think information about this meeting and this deliberation of the advisory committee is out in the media, and maybe, uh, reaching the level of awareness of many of our patients. And so regardless of the outcome of these deliberations, perhaps some careful communication needs to happen, and that should probably happen at multiple levels, reaching providers, patients, consumer groups, and maybe in a variety of formats.

## CDC, ACIP members, and companies on updated COVID vaccines

- **Source:** [webcast](https://video.ibm.com/channel/VWBXKBR8af4) of Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting
- **Date:** broadcasted September 12, 2023

>  Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [10:26:24]
>  
> I'll echo that we're also aware that there's a lot of interest in having non mRNA vaccine options available. And we also look forward to the potential authorization of the updated vaccine.
> 
> It's important to note that the voting language that is going to be presented later today is inclusive of FDA licensed or authorized updated monovalent XBB containing COVID 19 vaccines, including those that may be licensed or authorized in coming months.
> 
> So this would allow such vaccines to be incorporated into programs immediately following FDA regulatory action. And that won't require that ACIP be reconvened. So I hope that this will facilitate the availability of the Novavax vaccine once FDA has reviewed and potentially authorized.
> 
> ...
> 
> Natalie Thornburg, CDC [10:44:20]
> 
> It's kind of evolving in two different, I don't want to say clades, but two different versions of BA.2.86 right now.
> 
> There are two U.S. sequences that are highlighted with yellow arrows. So one that was detected in Michigan and another sequence that was detected in Ohio.
> 
> Next slide please.
> 
> So BA.2.86 has more than 30 amino acid substitutions in spike in comparison to XBB.1.5. And as far as the sequencing goes, that's a similar change in amino acid of spike during that Delta to Omicron shift.
> 
> There's variations between sequences due to missing data and sequencing artifacts, but then there also may be some variations in it, in some of the viruses themselves.
> 
> ...
> 
> Natalie Thornburg, CDC [10:45:21]
> 
> Again, it was first detected in specimens collected in late July 2023. And as of last week, there were seven clinical specimens, seven sequences, in seven U.S. states, and then there was one additional state detection in wastewater.
> 
> We may have a couple more this week and in coming weeks, but the take home message is we have a very small number of viruses detected in the United States thus far. And as of last week, it had been detected in 10 different countries.
> 
> We're still dealing with a fairly small number of sequences.
> 
> ...
> 
> Natalie Thornburg, CDC [10:51:03]
> 
> So as a reminder, um, more than 90% of circulating viruses are XBB lineage viruses with an additional, one to two substitutions in RBD, I'm sorry, this slide is not correct, but okay.
> 
> More than 90% of circulating viruses are XBB lineage viruses with one to two additional substitutions.
> BA.2.86 is a newly detected lineage with 30 amino acid substitutions in spike.
> 
> Thus far the number of viruses detected is still low. Sequence numbers are too low to calculate proportion though, so we don't know if BA.2.86 will be of any significant circulation.
> 
> Preliminary pseudovirus neutralization data generated by multiple labs do not indicate a large reduction in neutralization activity.
> 
> ...
> 
> Natalie Thornburg, CDC [10:52:11]
> 
> CDC has generated two authentic isolates of BA.2.86. One confirmed and one putative.
> 
> We are in the process of distributing BA.2.86 viruses to multiple labs to do transmission studies, more neutralization studies, against lots of different kinds sera.
> 
> And then we have another putative isolate, which is from a slightly different version of BA.2.86.
> We're also locally working on titrations before neutralization studies.
> 
> ...
> 
> Fiona Havers, CDC [11:05:46]
> 
> In summary, next slide, hospitalization rates have increased in all age groups since mid July.
> Hospitalization rates remain highest in older adults and in young infants, less than six months of age.
> 
> Most children under five hospitalized COVID 19 illness have no underlying medical conditions. A higher proportion of hospitalized children in adolescents in older age groups for those 5 to 17 years have underlying medical conditions.
> 
> And not surprisingly, most hospitalized adults have multiple underlying medical conditions.
> 
> COVID 19 continues to cause severe illness, with a substantial proportion of patients being admitted to the ICU in all age groups and clinical outcomes. While it varies a little bit by age group, are generally comparable to influenza associated hospitalizations, and most children and adults hospitalized for COVID 19, since January 2023 had not received a bivalent booster prior to hospitalization.
> 
> ...
> 
> Fiona Havers, CDC [11:37:20]
> 
> We are collecting data at the time. Right now, we don't have any data specifically on those infants who are hospitalized, but that is something that we're looking into in, in data collection, on maternal vaccination of hospitalized infants is ongoing at the moment, but I apologize, I don't have that available today.
> 
> ...
> 
> Fiona Havers, CDC [11:45:37]
> 
> We do have data on that. We collect symptoms on all of our— when we do the medical chart review, I would say that the vast majority of children under five presented with respiratory symptoms who are admitted with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.
> 
> And I will say that the data that— I think that most children are having respiratory symptoms, they are, some of them are being admitted with fever and other things. I don't have a breakdown of symptoms on the slides here, but I'm happy to provide that after we do collect those data.
> 
> I would say, generally speaking, respiratory symptoms, such as cough, fever, shortness of breath, and then also symptoms like bronchiolitis in younger children are fairly common, but I don't have a breakdown on these slides here, but I think that most of the children that we're talking about here today, including among young infants, do have respiratory symptoms.
> 
> ...
> 
> Filip Dubovsky, Novavax [01:14:31]
> 
> So the Novavax vaccine filing is under active review by the FDA. So this slide includes some forward looking statements, pending final authorization.
> 
> We understand our vaccine will be indicated for individuals 12 years of age and older, consistent with the age indication of last year's vaccine. The vaccine will be distributed in two vials per carton, with five doses per vial, so each carton contains 10 doses, and the dose volume is 0.5 mls per dose. The same dose is used in all authorized age groups.
> 
> Our product is ready to use requiring no reconstitution and can be administered with standard needles and syringes routinely stocked in vaccine clinics. And the vaccine is shipped and stored as standard refrigerator temperature, and currently has a nine month shelf life, and is to be used within 12 hours of initial puncture of the vial.
> 
> In discussion with the FDA, we understand the single dose will be indicated for people who have been previously vaccinated, irrespective of which vaccine they received, and a two dose series 21 days apart, is to be used for those who have not been previously vaccinated.
> 
> ...
> 
> Kayvon Modjarrad, Pfizer [01:34:18]
> 
> We have not had any use as of yet, but we will have a vaccine available as early as tomorrow in the U.S. in some locations.
> 
> ...
> 
> Frances Priddy, Moderna [01:40:22]
> 
> So the list price for our vaccine is 129 per dose. Thank you.
> 
> ...
> 
> (unclear), Pfizer [01:40:39]
> 
> The list price for Pfizer vaccine is 120 dollars per dose.
> 
> ...
> 
> John Trizzino, Novavax [01:41:03]
> 
> The list and/or WAC price that we refer to, ours is 130 dollars per dose, which in industry conditions is subject to contract pricing and discounts. Also of note is that our contracted price with CDC is 72.50 per dose.
> 
> ...
> 
> Matthew Daley, ACIP [01:43:49]
> 
> I have heard from small private practices about a minimum order amount, something like 200 doses. And I just think that creates barriers. 
> 
> So I would ask all the manufacturers to consider reducing what the minimum amount that practices need to order, just because that's a significant financial outlay, maybe 20,000 dollars, and it's for a practice who might need to buy multiple doses for multiple different age ranges, for example, a small family medicine practice. And so then that just presents a barrier.
> 
> ...
> 
> Megan Wallace, CDC [01:56:31]
> 
> During our discussions, the work group asked to investigate if young people with no underlying conditions, were still having severe illness from COVID 19. We know that that underlying conditions put you at risk, for higher risk, sorry— put you at higher risk for severe COVID 19 outcomes. And that the percent of the population that has underlying conditions differs dramatically by age.
> 
> To evaluate the burden among those without underlying conditions, we looked at the percent hospitalized for COVID 19 that have no underlying conditions by age group, which is the first column, and of those hospitalized with no underlying conditions, what percent were admitted to the ICU, which is the middle column, the final percent of those admitted to the ICU— and finally, what percent of those admitted to the ICU had no underlying conditions, which is the far right column in each of these categories.
> 
> We see that those without underlying conditions are progressing to severe illness, though we should note that these percentages should be interpreted with the understanding that children have a lower probability of having underlying conditions overall.
> 
> I also want to mention that these findings of people ages six months to 49 years with no underlying conditions progressing to severe outcomes due to COVID 19 was confirmed in other CDC platforms.
> 
> ...
> 
> Megan Wallace, CDC [02:01:13]
> 
> In summary, COVID 19 burden is currently lower than a previous points in the pandemic. However, the absolute number of hospitalizations and deaths is still high.
> 
> 
> Although hospitalization rates are currently low, we have seen rates increase in recent weeks and anticipate further increases as we enter respiratory virus season.
> 
> Infants and older adults have the highest COVID 19 associated hospitalization rates, children and adults with no underlying medical conditions still experience severe illness due to COVID 19.
> 
> We saw in Dr. Saydah's presentation earlier that post COVID conditions are common following SARS-CoV-2 infection, decrease with time since infection, and have decreased since the start of the pandemic.
> People of racial and ethnic minority groups continue to be disproportionately impacted by COVID 19. High proportions of underlying conditions may put certain groups at increased risk for severe outcomes due to COVID 19. Next.
> 
> When asked is COVID 19 disease among persons six months and older of public health importance, the majority workgroup opinion was yes, next.
> 
> ...
> 
> Megan Wallace, CDC [02:20:30]
> 
> COVID 19 vaccine benefits are anticipated in all age groups, but the benefits of COVID 19 vaccines vary by age and incidence of COVID 19 hospitalizations.
> 
> The benefits outweigh the risks in groups for which which risk of myocarditis is highest.
> 
> Modeling projects more hospitalizations and deaths are averted when updated doses are universally recommended compared to no recommendation or recommendation only for person 65 years and older.
> 
> ...
> 
> Megan Wallace, CDC [02:24:12]
> 
> This slide shows intent to get a new updated COVID 19 vaccine as of August.
> 42% of respondents reported that they definitely will or probably will get the COVID 19 vaccine this fall. Next.
> 
> Based on data from the bivalent vaccine uptake and intent, we see that intent is highly related to receipt of previous COVID 19 vaccine doses. Those that had a past COVID 19 vaccination were more likely to have received a bivalent vaccine dose while the majority of the unvaccinated reported that they probably or definitely will not get a bivalent vaccine dose. Next.
> 
> And when we look at the top concerns or issues regarding the bivalent vaccine, among those that reported that they probably or definitely will not get the vaccine regardless of past vaccination status, the most commonly reported concern was unknown serious side effects.
> 
> Next, this slide shows reported confidence in vaccine safety for COVID 19 vaccine, influenza vaccine, and other routine vaccines. Confidence in vaccine safety is higher for influenza and other routine adult vaccines than for the COVID 19 vaccine, with only about half of respondents reporting that the COVID 19 vaccine is completely or very safe. Next.
> 
> ...
> 
> Megan Wallace, CDC [02:27:36]
> 
> This slide shows fall vaccination intent by age group.
> 
> We can see that the vaccine intent increases by age, with those ages 65 years and older being the most likely to report intent to vaccinate. This trend is also seen with other vaccines, such as flu.
> 
> Next.
> 
> And this intent to get a fall COVID 19 vaccine mirrors the uptake we saw with the bivalent doses, with older adults, having a much higher coverage than younger adults and children.
> 
> Next.
> 
> Intent to get a new updated COVID 19 vaccine varies some, but not substantially, by race and ethnicity.
> 
> ...
> 
> Megan Wallace, CDC [02:32:17]
> 
> There are still barriers to implementation. There are now three seasonal vaccines and preventative products, including COVID 19 vaccine, influenza vaccine, and RSV vaccine and preventative products, which means there are more vaccines to manage, limited storage space for more vaccines, and more opportunity for vaccine administration errors.
> 
> Providers will need to adapt to new cap and label colors, and all three manufacturers now have products with blue caps, introducing opportunity for error. Next.
> 
> ...
> 
> Megan Wallace, CDC [02:35:30]
> 
> In summary, COVID 19 vaccination is a cost effective intervention, particularly in persons ages 65 years and older in which the vaccine is cost saving.
> 
> Cost effectiveness estimates in those ages 50 years and older were robust to input changes across plausible ranges.
> 
> Cost effectiveness estimates in those 18 to 49 years were sensitive to changes in inputs. 
> 
> If vaccine effectiveness or hospitalization rates are higher than anticipated, the cost effectiveness estimates would be more favorable.
> 
> Cost effectiveness estimates are not yet available for the pediatric population. 
> 
> Next, for equity we considered, if the intervention is a reasonable and efficient allocation of resources across all populations. Next. 
> 
> COVID 19 vaccination is most cost effective in older adults in which disease burden is highest compared to younger adults. COVID 19 vaccination is likely more cost effective in populations with risk factors, such as underlying conditions, which increase their probability of hospitalization due to COVID 19.
> 
> Additional work is ongoing to evaluate cost effectiveness in the pediatric populations. Next.
> 
> When asked if the 2023-2024 COVID 19 vaccine is a reasonable and efficient allocation of resources, the majority opinion was yes, with a minority opinion of probably yes. Next. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Megan Wallace, CDC [02:43:43]
> 
> Finally, we have an optional— we had an optional second bivalent dose for those ages 65 years and older. We do not have an additional dose recommendation for the 2023-2024 vaccine at this time.
> We will monitor the epidemiology and vaccine effectiveness to determine if additional doses are needed.
> 
> ...
> 
> Megan Wallace, CDC [02:38:47]
> 
> The work group considered non universal policy options with considerable discussion around the magnitude of benefits in the young, healthy population. As part of these deliberations, the work group requested additional data on severe illness due to COVID 19 in those with, and without underlying conditions, there was no group that clearly had no risk of severe illness.
> 
> Additionally, the vast majority of the U.S. population had an underlying condition that would qualify under a risk based recommendation, prevalence of overweight and obesity alone account, or is over 70% in adults.
>

> Burden of severe illness due to COVID 19 is lowest among children ages five to 17 years, despite lower burden relative to other age groups, hundreds of deaths due to COVID 19 occurred in this age group in 2021 and 2022.
> 
> Half of pediatric COVID 19 deaths were in individuals with no underlying conditions. The number of COVID 19 associated hospitalizations and deaths in this age group are comparable to the burden seen in other vaccine preventable diseases for which there are universal recommendations. There are potential additional benefits of vaccination, such as prevention of post COVID conditions. And the potential for reduced school. absenteeism.

> Risk of myocarditis appears lower than the risk observed following the primary series doses, which may be due to the increased interval between doses. However, certainty is limited by relatively lower sample size of booster recipients in VSD.

> The available information has been presented today. As far as I know, no additional information will be available, that would be able to be presented at an upcoming meeting, following regulatory action.
> 
> So, we certainly could reconvene the meeting, we always can reconvene ACIP if it feels necessary, but given the fact that no additional information is expected to be available, it feels like this is the kind of vote that we can move to a more normal cadence of things such as we do for recommendations like for influenza vaccine, where we don't necessarily need to reconvene the committee when additional products are licensed under existing recommendations.

> The federal contracts that have been modified in order to hasten delivery of the 2023-24 COVID 19 vaccines within our public health infrastructure for both children and adults will allow us to have the first doses available within 48 hours of the expected recommendation.

> There will also be the retail pharmacies that have been contracted to provide doses for uninsured Americans through the Bridge Access Program, will also have availability within about that same time period, and we are expecting the commercial insurance will—commercial product will be expected around that same timeframe as well.

> 
> However, in addition to this, for COVID 19 vaccines, specifically in the CARES Act, there was statement that expedites coverage of COVID 19 vaccines, so that they are available immediately upon authorization under EUA or approved under a BLA. And you can see the more detailed information right here.

> I certainly think that those aged, the elderly, adults whether they're 65 or greater than 55, should, I would recommend that, as well as certain risk groups, certainly the immunocompromised, in pregnancy, but I think that we need to be— we need to be aware and let the public know that the data on children is not there. And for that, I think that discussion needs to be had. So I think in non-high risk groups, I would favor a shared decision making. And, and again, in even the concern for the— for the 12 or 15 to 39 year old, the myocarditis risk, I recognize that— that it hasn't been seen with the bivalent dosing, but the uptake has been low for that.

> Well, so I think we need to be— we really need to level with our patients and say, what is known and unknown, rather than make a complete recommendation, especially for some groups that there are limited data.

> 
> There was some concern that the work group entered its to deliberations this summer assuming that a universal vaccination strategy was the obvious policy choice, but I just want to reiterate that that was very much not the case. The work group reviewed this as an opportunity to reevaluate the vaccination program. And we essentially started with a blank slate.
> 
> And so related, we, the work group, asked our CDC colleagues to update and present data on disease burden by age group for those with and without chronic medical conditions. And that was the most persuasive line of argument for me, knowing that there were deaths, including in children, including in those without chronic conditions, and my perception is that that those deaths are vaccine preventable.
> 
> And when we asked for this burden data, the focus was on serious disease, including hospitalization, ICU, admission, and death, and Dr. Wallace summarized all this for us and, and suffice it to say that the disease burden does very greatly by age, but there is serious illness, death across all age groups, including among those without underlying medical conditions.
> 
> So there may be a day where we revisit a risk based strategy. We always should consider this, but in order for that to be a desirable approach, I think we need to feel confident that disease burden in those not at risk, we need to be quite low and that's low in absolute terms of cases of serious illness and death, but also low in relative terms relative to the burden of disease, for other diseases against which we have a universal vaccine recommendation.

> ...
> 
> Beth Bell, ACIP [03:31:49]
> 
> I think today we've heard a wealth of evidence about the risks, the benefits, extremely comprehensive dealing with the issue, and I, to Dr. Daley's point, I think that it indicates there's all kinds of robust information that show robust benefits of vaccination on severe illness on death, probably on long COVID.
> 
> And, so with a reasonable safety profile, granted not exactly with this vaccine, but with, a very similar vaccine. So I think that it's clear that vaccination is going to prevent serious illness and death across all age groups. It is a vaccine preventable disease. And so I, for that reason, favor universal recommendation.
> 
> Now having said that, I, because I think it's important for people to have access to the vaccine, if they want it.
> 
> 
> Having said that, I also want to say that there's not equal risk across all ages and populations. And it's clear that there are certain people, like old people like me, people with underlying medical conditions, that are much higher risk of dying. And so I think that the messaging needs to sort of clarify that and make clear that there is this differential risk, and that a lot of people with underlying medical conditions and who are older are dying, and they really need to get a booster.

> ...
> 
> Barbara Mahon, CDC [03:38:07]
> 
> I just wanted to say that, very mindful of the groups that are at substantially higher risk and are planning targeted communications to try to have vigorous and compelling outreach to those groups, that can be done regardless of whether a recommendation is targeted or not.
> 
> So under a universal recommendation, we will still have targeted communications for older adults, immunocompromised persons, and others at higher risk.
> 
> ...
> 
> Pablo Sanchez, ACIP [03:55:16]
> 
> I just want to be clear that I am not against this vaccine. The data do look great. The limited data that are available does look great, even though it may not be the most, you know, the circulating variants currently, but it has neutralizing activity against the other variants and certainly the ones that are circulating now or expected to be circulating.
> 
> I am very much pro vaccination, and certainly high risk groups.
> 
> I do— I just want to comment that we have extremely limited data on children and infants and other individuals, and so I think that needs to be made available then to the parents. And I also think that in certain circumstances, we do have to be concerned about potential side effects, especially in the, you know, in young adults and young adult males.
> 
> And so I think all of that needs to be weighed. And so that's why I hesitate to make it just a universal recommendation, even though I do support vaccination with the COVID vaccine.

## CMS spokesperson on coverage for updated COVID vaccines

> An FAQ the Departments of HHS, Labor, and Treasury released on October 4, 2021, states in relevant part as follows:
> 
> “In a December 12, 2020 meeting, ACIP recommended: “For purposes of ACIP’s role under the Affordable Care Act, ACIP recommends use of COVID-19 vaccines within the scope of the Emergency Use Authorization or Biologics License Application for the particular vaccine.” On the same day, the Director of the CDC adopted this ACIP recommendation. Although ACIP has made additional recommendations regarding COVID-19 vaccines since December 12, 2020, none of those recommendations affect plan and issuer coverage obligations regarding COVID-19 vaccines under the preventive services regulations, and therefore the December 12, 2020 recommendation remains in effect for this purpose. The requirement under section 3203 of the CARES Act for plans and issuers to cover COVID-19 vaccines consistent with this ACIP recommendation became effective 15 business days after the December 12, 2020 adoption by the CDC. Therefore, effective January 5, 2021, plans and issuers must cover, without cost sharing, any COVID-19 vaccine authorized under an EUA or approved under a BLA by the FDA immediately upon the vaccine becoming authorized or approved. This coverage must be provided consistent with the scope of the EUA or BLA for the particular vaccine, including any EUA or BLA amendment, such as to allow for the administration of an additional dose to certain individuals, administration of booster doses, or the expansion of the age demographic for whom the vaccine is authorized or approved.”
