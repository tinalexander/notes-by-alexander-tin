> An FAQ the Departments of HHS, Labor, and Treasury released on October 4, 2021, states in relevant part as follows:
> 
> “In a December 12, 2020 meeting, ACIP recommended: “For purposes of ACIP’s role under the Affordable Care Act, ACIP recommends use of COVID-19 vaccines within the scope of the Emergency Use Authorization or Biologics License Application for the particular vaccine.” On the same day, the Director of the CDC adopted this ACIP recommendation. Although ACIP has made additional recommendations regarding COVID-19 vaccines since December 12, 2020, none of those recommendations affect plan and issuer coverage obligations regarding COVID-19 vaccines under the preventive services regulations, and therefore the December 12, 2020 recommendation remains in effect for this purpose. The requirement under section 3203 of the CARES Act for plans and issuers to cover COVID-19 vaccines consistent with this ACIP recommendation became effective 15 business days after the December 12, 2020 adoption by the CDC. Therefore, effective January 5, 2021, plans and issuers must cover, without cost sharing, any COVID-19 vaccine authorized under an EUA or approved under a BLA by the FDA immediately upon the vaccine becoming authorized or approved. This coverage must be provided consistent with the scope of the EUA or BLA for the particular vaccine, including any EUA or BLA amendment, such as to allow for the administration of an additional dose to certain individuals, administration of booster doses, or the expansion of the age demographic for whom the vaccine is authorized or approved.”
