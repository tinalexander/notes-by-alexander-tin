## CDC director at a Yale School of Public Health event

- **Source:** [recording](https://youtu.be/LNXisftWb68) from Yale School of Public Health
- **Date:** published October 6, 2023

> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:17:02]
> 
> I think the critical linchpin of public health is to bring visibility, data and evidence to trying to solve how we protect health, whether it's identifying and responding to a respiratory virus, or our first cases of domestically acquired malaria, which we had this year, first in 20 years, or it's understanding overdoses from different types of  fentanyl or xylazine, right. 
> 
> Having that data, that transparency, is critical to building trust. So transparency for us was absolutely fundamental. And what what's hard as, about transparency, is science is constantly evolving. As we know, we are learning more things. So it's really critical to be able to say, this is what I know. This is what I don't know. And importantly, this is what I'm working on to know, and I'll come back to you, and you can trust that this public health is not a black box. 
> 
> And I can't tell you still, I was just with a round table of reporters yesterday who said that public health's a black box to us, help us understand it better. We want to be your champions, but we don't understand it. Let us in. 
> 
> All right. So transparency, I think, builds trust. And in North Carolina, leading through the COVID crisis, we did a press conference every day at two o'clock for six months. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:44:47]
> 
> I'm so proud of CDC and only being there three months, I take no credit for this, but it is honestly the most equity focused organization that I had have been part of. And I'm very proud of the North Carolina work, but it was a lot of like new work.
> 
> When I come to CDC and I see it, the equity work is embedded everywhere in a great way. And they think about populations and they are thinking about migrants and their health at all times. And thinking about how do we make sure we're understanding what they need and, and think about it.
> 
> So, for example, I was just on the phone with folks in New York who are seeing a lot of new immigrants and migrants that are there and how can we help them with, from an infectious disease place, but also from housing and things like that. 
> 
> So CDC, like that's, I give them a ton of credit for doing incredible work. The resources are what is missing there. It's not the passion, it's not the strategy, it's resources in order to make sure that we can help all those communities.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:47:37]
> 
> I had a question on behalf of a person I know who's on dialysis and they were wondering why it's not required for healthcare workers to wear N95 respirators in healthcare settings, especially when decades of research showed that respirators are more effective than surgical masks at preventing airborne diseases. And, with like 60% of COVID infections, asymptomatic, and hospital acquired infections four times higher risk of mortality?
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:48:11]
> 
> So, great question. So we have different teams who are looking at some of these issues right now, and I think updating some of the guidance, right? So I think you want to look at-- we look at a couple of factors when thinking about it.
> 
> Sure, is an N95 gonna certainly filter out more things than a surgical mask? Yes. We know how those work, right. If you have something that's fit tested, and the different material. 
> 
> So, but the question is what are the things that you need to wear in an N95 for? And what are the things where surgical barrier masks make sense? And you want to look both at the way the infection is spread, but also what is the risk, right? 
> 
> So we spread a lot of things that are are aerosolized, but there they're different levels of risk. 
> 
> It is good news in 2023, where we are related to COVID, 97% of us have either had it or have been vaccinated by it. So we aren't in the same place we were in 2020 when we had an entire population that's never been exposed. 
> 
> Now I wouldn't, I have to be on brand for CDC director, I'm glad we got to this, our immunity is going down. The virus is changing. Please all get your updated COVID vaccine. Even those of us who are-- I'm almost was saying, I'm as young as you, I'm not, I'm getting my vaccine, but please everyone at every age should get it as well as your flu shot. 
> 
> But my point is, is that we have to think about levels of risk for all of those different kinds of diseases, versus in terms of what is the protection level that we need. And so those are the kinds of research that the team goes through. 
> 
> We actually have an independent advisory committee that is going through some of that work right now, to understand the data, and what, how do you map to the right protection? Because it's both, how is it transmitted, but also like, what is the risk to all of the patients, and we sort of need to balance all of those things.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:58:24]
> 
> What I'm trying to do at CDC is make us the best collaborator we absolutely possibly could be. 
> 
> Now I think data is the power behind that because, like that visualization, but it's building a muscle of collaboration is different, right. How-- like--
> 
> Candidly, CDC does not have, right now, someone who owns engagement, stakeholder engagement.
> 
> We want to call it something else, but doesn't have that function, right? But if we're gonna be the best collaborator and if this is a team sport, we absolutely have to build that muscle differently. 
> 
> So those are the kinds of things I'm working on at CDC, but we have a lot to offer in and of itself, right? With the, the data, evidence, and best practices so that we can go to someone like CMS and be like, 'you know what you should be paying for is X not Y.' Or we can go to SAMHSA and say, you know what, we we've studied this best practice in suicide prevention, this is where you should put your money.

## CMS spokesperson on nursing home COVID-19 vaccinations data

- **Source:** email from a CMS spokesperson
- **Date:** received October 6, 2023

> CMS COVID-19 nursing home vaccination figures are based on information reported by nursing homes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) COVID-19 Long Term Care Facility Module.
> 
> On September 15, 2023, the CDC updated its recommendation regarding what is required for individuals to be up to date with their COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccination rates currently reported on data.cms.gov, as of September 24, 2023, are based on the previous recommendations. CMS is working with the CDC and plan to post vaccination rates based on the new recommendations to stay up to date with the COVID-19 vaccine soon.

## CDC officials at HRSA webinar on COVID-19 vaccines

- **Source:** [webinar](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/funding/coronavirus-related-funding/covid-19-bridge-funding) by Health Resources and Services Administration
- **Date:** broadcasted October 5, 2023

> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:17:54]
> 
> Prior to September of this year, COVID 19 vaccines were not yet on the commercial marketplace. They were bought and sold and allocated and distributed by the U.S. federal government program for COVID 19 vaccine distribution. And we are not in that era anymore. 
> 
> The Bridge Access Program does not replace that program. The Bridge Access Program is a critical, but temporary and limited measure that exists to strengthen and protect the coverage of adults without insurance or whose insurance will not fully cover the cost of COVID-19 vaccination in this period, as we are transitioning into COVID-19 vaccine commercialization. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:18:47]
> 
> Now, how did figure out how many vaccines? That means, apart from purchasing as many as we could with the funding we were able to secure, what did that look like? 
> 
> So we looked at the estimated adults who are uninsured in the U.S., and this was based on the number of adults who would be eligible in the fiscal year 24 season, which was also modified by the increase that we knew to expect in rates of uninsurance, due to Medicaid unwinding. So that's where we got our estimation of 30 million adults who are uninsured. 
> 
> And then we estimated optimistically 20% vaccine uptake per season in this population. And why am I crossing my fingers and making it look like 20% is an optimistic goal?
> 
> During the 2022-2023 season, the estimated uptake among uninsured adults, and this is pre-commercialization, in other words, this is in the era when vaccines were free to everyone, was just under 11%. So 20%, if we got 20% uptake, it would be just under twice the uptake that we saw in our preceding season. 
> 
> And so if you multiply these together, you find that you need 6 million Bridge Access Program doses for the fiscal year, 2024 season, in order to provide an estimated 20% coverage of an estimated 30 million adults who are uninsured. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:20:45]
> 
> We did some geographic analyses, which I'm not gonna get into in super depth here, but we observed that we needed to make about a 50 50 split between public health infrastructure and retail pharmacies, or sorry, contracted pharmacies, to really maximize proximity to free COVID 19 vaccination through the Bridge Access Program.
> 
> ...
> 
> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:21:07]
> 
> And so there are approximately 3 million doses moving through the public health infrastructure side and approximately 3 million doses moving through the contracted pharmacy side.
> 
> 3 million doses can sound like a big number until you consider the many jurisdictions this needs to cover, including the many health centers that this needs to cover. So this is a long way of saying two things. 
> 
> One, these numbers are smaller than all of us are used to from the era of the U.S. federal program for COVID 19 vaccine distribution. Two, this is another way of saying this is not a permanent or comprehensive solution. It is not. 
> 
> It is a critical temporary solution. It supports continued access. It is not enough. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:23:32]
> 
> Our current data through survey of our jurisdictions shows that allocation and distribution to these health centers is currently exceeding 25%. 
> 
> So I'm going to show you two different total slides here, with one break in the middle of this data, this one is an average, and it's over the week of September 25th through September 29th, finding that among jurisdictions who were able to respond and had data to report, 35.2% of the Bridge Access Program doses had been allocated to HRSA-supported health centers and 27.5% of Bridge Access Program doses had actually been delivered to health centers. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:34:21]
> 
> The important point on this question, how are we determining uninsured status, is that we designed this program to provide minimal barriers to patients seeking COVID 19 vaccination and yet maximal protection from any concerns of fraud or misuse. 
> 
> And that is because all the patient needs to do is state that they are uninsured. So I'm going to go ahead and address a question right here. Do they need documentation? Do they need to somehow prove that they don't have insurance? 
> 
> No, they do not. And please do encourage your populations and your constituencies to go get this vaccine. They do not have to prove anything.
> 
> Which means they don't need to be citizens. They don't need to be residents. They don't need to have these documents with them or at all.
> 
> The burden is on our health systems. So we have articulated very clearly in contracts with all of our participating providers, how they will be checking insurance status, how they will be completing the insurance discovery processes on the backend. 
> 
> But this is not something that we want our community members to face.
> 
> ...
> 
> Jeanne Santoli, CDC [00:36:29]
> 
> There is a, there's a packing list that actually show the fund type of the vaccine.
> 
> So 317 is gonna be the Bridge funded doses and VFC will be the VFC doses. So that standard packing list that you get will indicate, if shipments are combined.
> 
> Pfizer doesn't combine shipments, so they will all be separate. You won't have to wonder which is which because they won't combine multiple order lines in one shipment. 
> 
> And I mentioned Pfizer specifically since their vaccines are actually directly shipped from the manufacturer versus the Moderna and Novavax, which are actually distributed by CDC's centralized distributor McKesson.
> 
> ...
> 
> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:37:44]
> 
> It is designed to cover anyone without insurance. Now it's not-- it's not designed necessarily for medical tourism, but in order to reduce those barriers, we're not demanding documentation. 
> 
> I know that border populations often have a lot of questions of particular interest. The important point is that barriers to vaccination are minimal and that we're leaning on our systems, not on our patients, to document insurance.
> 
> ...
> 
> Jeanne Santoli, CDC [00:41:43]
> 
> So, the orders go through the state health department because the state health departments have sort of information about the amount of vaccine that's available. They have a certain amount of supply that's available that they make available to providers. 
> 
> They don't do the distribution. They don't have the doses physically on hand, but when orders come in, they manage those orders, they review those orders, and then based on that, they're sent forward to the distributor or the manufacturer and that's who actually sends the doses to the provider location to the health center location. 
> 
> So the states have an important role, but they're not actually doing the distribution. And that is just as it is in the VFC program.

- **Date:** broadcasted October 5, 2023

> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:09:47]
> 
> I wanted to say that to acknowledge though that it's been a challenge, but also to ask you, if you have signed up for a vaccine only to have your appointment canceled, or if you've been calling your doctor's office waiting to know when the vaccine was going to be available, please don't give up. There's not a supply -- there's not a crunch on the supply side. There is indeed quite a bit of vaccine that's being manufactured. Now it is working its way through the system. 
> 
> So please don't give up on vaccines. There is a vaccine out there with your name on it.
> 
> ...
> 
> Amanda Cohn, CDC [00:31:48]
> 
> So if you've had a recent COVID vaccine or have had COVID, the infection itself, we recommend you wait about eight weeks or two months before you get that updated vaccine.
> 
> You can get it earlier, but in order to make sure you have the best immune response, we think about eight weeks is the right amount of time to wait.
> 
> ...
> 
> Amanda Cohn, CDC [00:33:25]
> 
> So at this time, we're recommending that everyone who has previously been vaccinated get one dose of this updated COVID vaccine. 
> 
> We know that there may be a need for people who are severely immunocompromised to get additional doses. We are waiting to provide exact guidance on when those additional doses should happen. And you know, it would not surprise me if people who have-- who are severely or moderately immunocompromised get additional dose in about six months, but right now everyone just needs one single dose.
> 
> ...
> 
> Amanda Cohn, CDC [00:38:31]
> 
> Ensuring access in rural communities is especially important to us. And we totally understand that there are often people have to travel further to find vaccine, and we want to reduce that gap. 
> 
> There are more Bridge Access Program providers being onboarded every day, including pharmacies health department clinics and federally qualified health centers. So I encourage you if, if you haven't found one close enough yet, to reach back out or to reach to your health department and say, we need a location in near us, can you help us, can you help enroll? 
> 
> It is our local and state health departments that are enrolling the 317 healthcare providers in this program. We are strongly encouraging the pharmacies who are involved to have a vaccine available in all locations. 
> 
> But, really I think, we are relying on our local health departments to fill in some of those gaps through their healthcare providers. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:40:02]
> 
> If you're in a community that does not have a close by HRSA supported health center, a CVS, a Walgreens or other 317 enrolled provider, and you do have an independent or smaller pharmacy, we do encourage you to direct them to eTrueNorth to explore participation in the Bridge Access Program.
> 
> ...
> 
> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:40:57]
> 
> We have two Bridge Access Program participating pharmacies who are specifically working towards setting up these community events. Those include Walgreens and eTrueNorth, and I've put an email for eTrueNorth in the chat and a website that contains a form to express your interest in a community event to Walgreens. 
> 
> These partners of ours are very eager to work with community based organizations to get vaccine out there. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Amanda Cohn, CDC [00:41:27]
> 
> And I'll just add that these-- the nice thing about these pharmacies is that they can vaccinate people who have insurance as well as people who don't, if they, as these, they put together these outreach vaccination clinics. 
> 
> So in many ways, that is a really good way to make sure everyone who you serve can get vaccinated and not having to split it out into two different approaches.

## American Immunization Registry Association on COVID-19 vaccine reporting

- **Source:** email from Rebecca Coyle of American Immunization Registry Association
- **Date:** received October 5, 2023

> Thank you for reaching out with questions. To my knowledge I am not aware of any additional jurisdictions requiring reporting since May, but we haven’t specifically surveyed since May either.
> 
> As the federal supply of COVID-19 vaccines ends, the federal requirement to report to the IIS ends and shifts to the reporting policy of the jurisdiction. These policies vary widely from state to state.

## Novo Nordisk statement on FDA investigation of counterfeit Ozempic

- **Source:** email from a Novo Nordisk spokesperson
- **Date:** received October 5, 2023

> Patient safety is a top priority for Novo Nordisk and in close collaboration with FDA, we have taken measures to create awareness of the potential for counterfeit products. We have developed a company press statement that is posted on our U.S. corporate website and includes a guide for identifying counterfeits. We have provided communications to a number of stakeholders, including wholesalers and pharmacists to ensure they are aware of the situation and also able to identify a potential counterfeit semaglutide injectable product. We are also making semaglutide.com available as a resource hub for US consumers, healthcare providers and retailers to provide information about responsible use of semaglutide, including how to recognize a counterfeit product.   

## CDC spokesperson on locally acquired malaria in Arkansas

- **Source:** email from Thomas Skinner of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
- **Date:** received October 5, 2023

> How many total, locally acquired malaria cases have been reported so far this year, following the report in Arkansas?
> 
> > In 2023, the number of locally acquired malaria cases have included seven (7) cases have been reported in Florida, one (1) case in Texas, one (1) case in Maryland, and one (1) case in Arkansas.
> 
> Has CDC identified any links between the Arkansas malaria case and other cases?
> 
> > There is no evidence to suggest the case of locally acquired malaria in Arkansas is related to the other locally acquired cases reported in the U.S. this year.
> 
> Has CDC been able to complete genomic analyses of any malaria cases so far into where the malaria cases may have originated from?
> 
> > CDC is working to conduct genetic characterization of the parasites associated with these cases, including genomic sequencing, to help understand parasite relatedness and likely geographical origin. Results of sequencing are shared with the states. Please refer to the local or state health department for specific information on testing results.

- **Date:** broadcasted October 4, 2023

> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:14:07]
> 
> So we've passed the peak of where we think that wave at the end of the summer was, but looking at the last number of years, we expect this to go up again.
> 
> So for now we are decreasing, but again, as we get into the winter months and particularly see more travel around Thanksgiving and Christmas, we definitely do expect COVID to be up again.
> 
> We're starting to see RSV in the Southeast, flu activity still low. So that's where we are state of play.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:21:13]
> 
> On the ordering side, um, there's a couple of differences with COVID 19 that that manufacturers have opened up. 
> 
> You can still order in the traditional way. You've always ordered your vaccines in a commercial space, but at least two of the manufacturers have also opened up direct ordering, right from the manufacturer. I know Pfizer and Moderna. The Novavax vaccine just came out this week. So we're trying to understand their ordering practices a bit more, but Pfizer and Moderna both have direct ordering opportunities. So if you are having any challenges with supply on the commercial side, through one of your distributors, so if you use one of your distributors and you'd like to order directly, you can.
> 
> There are also new changes in the return policies. So on, and different products have sort of different preparations.
> 
> On the Pfizer side, there are three doses in a vial. I know we heard concerns for example, about wastage or unused vaccine. Pfizer did change their policy just last week to say you can return any unused for a full refund. So that is also good news in terms of easing some of the ordering concerns.
> 
> On the Moderna side, they are single dose syringes. So it's not-- there's not a waste to issue there, but again, make sure you're talking to your distributor or the manufacturer about the rules of the road here, because they are a little bit different. Again, a bit of the feature of how we're doing this with now that we're working through the private sector. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:23:07]
> 
> VFC vaccines is the same way you'd order COVID as well as nirsevimab. So, nirsevimab is also able to order through the VFC program. We know that COVID 19 vaccines are shipped through CDCs central vaccine distributor or directly from the manufacturer, but say the process for ordering is still through your state or local immunization program. 
> 
> And then you'll get some email notifications again, this should seem, this should seem familiar hopefully to folks on the VFC side, but the commercial side is different, and we're trying
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:24:04]
> 
> So one of-- a couple questions that we've been getting a lot, so I wanted to just go through this here.
> 
> First is, can I borrow between VFC and private immunization stock? And the short answer is yes, we don't want to miss an opportunity to offer a vaccine to someone. So bidirectional borrowing is okay. We, you know, we want make sure if you borrow, that means you're going to pay back, right? But it is allowed, but it should try to not be the rule, but you can do it. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:24:34]
> 
> The next question was can I order smaller minimums through VFC because it- and the short answer also there is yes.
> 
> We've decreased the minimum quantities, again, so that you can order and we're in a pretty good-- we're getting into a better, I shouldn't say good yet, better rhythm with ordering and then getting the supply delivered so that you can manage through how much you need in terms of understanding how many appointments you might have at a flu, COVID, vaccine clinic. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:28:09]
> 
> We certainly wouldn't want a child to not get a vaccine because they don't have the same-- your practice doesn't have the same type of vaccine that their initial series was in. 
> 
> We have also had questions about if you do that, if pediatricians need to make reports, for example, into VAERS, and you do not need to.
> 
> So again, ideal, if it can be the same Moderna or Pfizer, but if you need to switch because of what you have available, top priority is to get these children vaccinated.
> 
> Question [00:28:37]
> 
> So that's also true for the youngest age group, the four year olds, the six year olds?
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:28:42]
> 
> That's right. That's right. So again, when you do the primary series, ideally to stick with the same manufacturer through that primary series, but if you get-- then you're into updates after that, not as much of a concern.
> 
> ...
> 
> Charlene Wong, CDC [00:34:58]
> 
> This is covered in Medicaid and CHIP and VFC. Also we've been working with you all at the AAP and as well as with our colleagues at CMS, because we know that commercial coverage is also really important. 
> 
> So, we've been working for example, to make sure that commercial payers have the information that they need and understand the importance of why now, coverage now, is very important in this respiratory season. So we really appreciate the partnership working with the AAP and with pediatricians across the country, so that we can all help the payers make those choices and make them quickly.
> 
> ...
> 
> Georgina Peacock, CDC [00:36:31]
> 
> If you think a child is likely to have insurance, but is not yet verified, we encourage you to use your private stock. And if the child is not covered, then you can exchange it with a VFC dose. So that's part of what we have been talking about about this bidirectional borrowing that has been given as guidance to our immunization programs. 
> 
> If you expect that this child will be on Medicaid, then obviously using VFC stock makes sense. And they would be eligible for a VFC dose. 
> 
> And we really understand that this is changing-- it's a difficult judgment to make in some cases. And so some of that is gonna be judgment, but hopefully that borrowing policy allows for some flexibility, so that children get the needed immunization.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:38:15]
> 
> We're going to be communicating with our hospitals and already have about this. And, one of the questions that we were answering earlier was about, can they be VFC providers and only stock part of the VFC recommended vaccines? And the answer is yes, we want to encourage folks if they are a specialty provider, like a birthing center to be able to offer the nirsevimab and hep B at the time of birth.
> 
> And so I think this is also an education for folks and we'll see that increase, but we're going to try to continue like we're doing today, to get that word out.
> 
> ...
> 
> Georgina Peacock, CDC [00:38:59]
> 
> We have given guidance to our immunization program awardees that they should-- that we're encouraging them to do this, to enroll more birthing hospitals. And one of the ways to help with this is to allow virtual visits for that initial visit to set up being a VFC provider, with likely, with a follow up later that would be in person. 
> 
> And so those are some flexibilities that we've put in the guidance and we meet regularly with our immunization awardees so that they can understand some of these flexibilities that have been put into place for niresfvimab, given that is really a very different type of product than we've dealt with before.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:44:00]
> 
> We are just-- we are calling it an RSV immunization. It is not a vaccine in the same way in which your body creates antibodies. This immunization gives you your baby antibodies, right, they are long acting antibodies and they provide protection for about six months. So that's the language we're using, is that in a vaccine, it allows your body to build its own antibodies. 
> 
> This RSV immunization gives the antibodies directly to your baby and they last about six months. So that's generally the language I have been using and you will see in our materials, but Dr. Wong, anything else you'd add there?
> 
> Charlene Wong, CDC [00:44:42]
> 
> The other thing is we actually also tested with moms to see how they understood this product and you know, what, how we named it. And we actually did this in collaboration with AAP and CMS as well. 
> 
> And immunization was the term that was really resonating with the moms and caregivers to these babies. So that's a one thing to mention. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:46:26]
> 
> There are a lot of insurance companies that are covering it, but it is not, I would not say, it is all at this point. And so I would want to make sure that you are talking with your insurance companies about that coverage on the private side.
> 
> Again, for VFC, for Medicaid, that is covered. But make sure, and again, we're continuing to work with insurance companies, and I think that we expect for them to move in that direction of coverage, but we want to make sure you're having that conversation. 
> 
> Additionally, we have not seen yet that they have changed the bundle payments for hospitals when you're in the hospital around birth yet.
> 
> That is work that still needs to happen over the next number of months. And we expect that to happen over time, but we, that is not something for this season that we expect to see in terms of bundle, the nirsevimab being included in the bundle.
> 
> ...
> 
> Charlene Wong, CDC [00:47:23]
> 
> We actually just heard, while we were talking today that, from the manufacturer, they're letting us know that they estimate that it's well over half of the commercial insurers that are covering nirsevimab for the outpatient setting. And, again, as we mentioned, we're really working hard with AAP and CMS to continue to get them the information they need so that we can get that number up even higher.
> 
> ...
> 
> Charlene Wong, CDC [00:51:07]
> 
> There are two administrative codes that were accepted. One is for administration of nirsevimab with counseling, by physician or other qualified health professional. And the second is that same, and that doesn't include the counseling. 
> 
> And this was really in recognition that the work that we all do at our clinics for the time to administer and the counseling is different for nirsevimab. So we're again grateful because we worked very closely with the AAP in making sure that the codes and such really met all of the various needs. 
> 
> We actually were just on a call with CMS right before this, and we're all very excited that these codes are now available. They're taking some of their next steps and making sure the payers will need to take some steps as, Dr. Cohen was saying both, on the particularly the commercial side. And so they're taking some next steps right away because we did just get this very hot off the press news from the AMA just the other day. And so CMS is taking that next step, and are looking forward to having these codes available for use.
> 
> They did expedite these codes so that sometimes when these new codes become available, there's even a longer lag before we, as providers are able to use them with the payers. They expedited this so that they become available as soon as the payers take the steps they need to take.

## CDC officials at briefing on fall respiratory virus season

- **Source:** briefing hosted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
- **Date:** broadcasted October 4, 2023

> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:35:14]
> 
> All three channels are open and available right now, and more and more sites are being added every single day. Indeed, it's one thing to talk about access, but we have to make sure that the pharmacy locations in particular are up and running as well as geographically spread around the country. 
> 
> As of last week, there were close to 19,000 pharmacy locations, comprising both Walgreens and CVS locations across the country. And as I mentioned, more and more sites are coming online every day, particularly independent pharmacies who have partnered with our colleagues at eTrueNorth to come online to make sure that vaccine is offered in places, for example, where there isn't as much coverage from Walgreens and CVS. 
> 
> So please, please note that if there's not a a location in your part of the part of the country right now, there may be in the near future as more and more independent pharmacies come online. That's on the pharmacy channel.
> 
> On the provider channel more and more channels are again coming online. And they're also increasing the administration of the vaccine that they're offering. 
> 
> As of just last week, over 6,600 pharmacy locations have administered at least one dose. And over 2,000 of the public health providers have placed at least a single order for COVID vaccines. 
> 
> Again, both of those sets of numbers are increasing week on week as more providers come online and they start ordering and administering vaccine. 
> 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kevin Griffis, CDC [00:42:43]
> 
> We've developed a suite of core messages to educate consumers around the fall and winter virus season, the importance of vaccination and other key preventative behaviors. 
> 
> We know that vaccination is the best way to stay protected against flu, COVID 19 and RSV, but there are other things we can do to help prevent the spread of viruses that includes covering cough and sneezes, frequent hand washing and staying home when sick, if you're able. We can go to the next slide.
> 
> Leaning into what we learned during our research, we developed an umbrella creative concept for our communications effort, our creative approach, which you'll see in a moment leverages emotional ties to loved ones as the key motivator to prevent respiratory diseases, amid fall and winter gathering season, while increasing awareness and perception of severity using a holistic prevention approach to counterbalance pandemic fatigue, and concerns around fear mongering for increased receptivity educates. 
> 
> It educates audiences about virus prevention behaviors, including masks and ventilation, and using icons as a tool while elevating vaccination as a key prevention strategy.  
> 
> With that, I will share a preview of our efforts, which are slated to launch in mid-October. What you'll see today is only a handful of assets that will be part of a larger effort, which with more iterations currently in development, as we continue to build out more assets that will go in the market through the end of the year.
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [00:49:41]
> 
> So first I want to just put a little bit of context, which is that the largest vaccine program in the history of the U.S. transitioned on September 12th from U.S. government distribution to commercial, that's a major milestone. 
> 
> A year of planning was critical in getting ready for this. And what we learned is that public health distribution of vaccine is a lot different than commercial distribution of the vaccine. And so what we saw was a gradual increase and are seeing a day by day and week by week increase in availability of vaccine in all of the many venues that you've heard about, whether they're pharmacies, medical providers, or other other folks who are vaccinators. 
> 
> So, we've been working really closely with all other parts of government, with other agencies, but also with the manufacturers of the vaccine, as well as the distributors, to really make sure that in this very historic shift in how this vaccine is distributed, that we're really making sure that we're getting the vaccine to folks who need it the most, specifically, thinking about folks who are at increased risk of complications from COVID 19, specifically older individuals, as well as some younger. 
> 
> So really, a lot of focus on, as we make this transition, really make sure that we're focusing on the folks that we serve and making sure the backseat is getting where it needs to get. I'll add on top of that, the Bridge program that you heard about in a lot of detail and Vaccines for Children have also been really critical in making sure that the vaccines that we do control in the U.S. government are getting to folks who need them.
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:51:19]
> 
> We're aware that folks have perhaps gone to a provider or a pharmacy hoping to have a vaccine for themselves or for their child, and there wasn't a vaccine there, and we're aware of those concerns and certainly those reports.
> 
> My message for folks who are in that, who have had that experience, is twofold. 
> 
> The first is please don't give up on the vaccine. Please know that vaccine is available, and as Demetre just mentioned, more and more vaccine is getting out there every single day, every single week. And so please check back in with your provider with your pharmacist, because it's likely if they didn't have vaccine two weeks ago, they will have it or have it now.
> 
> The second message is please know that the CDC is working on this. When we started receiving these reports, we, as Demetre said, made sure we were working with all of the different folks who were involved in the supply chain of vaccines to see what we could do to help lift barriers, or get folks together in the same room to try to solve the problem. 
> 
> The situation is getting better every single day. We know that that didn't-- we know that that meant that some folks maybe didn't have a shot waiting for them the day that they went.
> 
> But please know that there is a vaccine out there with your name on it.
> 
> ...
> 
> Kevin Griffis, CDC [00:52:41]
> 
> I know you're planning to update the forecast and I just wanted to get a sense of if you're seeing anything new and if there's anything notable that people should be aware of.
> 
> Dylan George, CDC [00:52:50]
> 
> There's a handful of uncertainties associated with trying to make these assessments going forward. 
> 
> And as I mentioned, the three big uncertainties that we're laser focused on is: is there a variant that would change our assessment of the epidemiological situation? And we're not seeing anything like that out there right now. 
> 
> The second one is, are we seeing a coincidence of the peaks of RSV, influenza and COVID coming together at some point. We're not seeing that either. 
> 
> And then the last one, are we seeing a particularly bad or severe flu season where you're seeing a lot of people requiring hospitalization? Fortunately right now there's low flu activity. We're not seeing that.
> 
> But we need to stay vigilant and watch all three areas. As I had mentioned before, we're learning more about each of these pathogens on a daily basis. As we learn more, we will update our assessments and we will update you at that time as well.
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [01:02:47]
> 
> We talk a lot about having tools this season and masking is and remains one of those tools. And I think what's most important to think about with respect to masking is making sure that we are creating space for anyone who wants to mask to be able to do so. 
> 
> Now there are a few situations in where, in which masking is important and situations that CDC recommend folks mask. 
> 
> One of them, for example, is after you've been exposed. And all of this is on our website, but after you've been exposed to someone who definitely had COVID, wearing a mask after that is a great way to limit the likelihood that you might accidentally expose someone in turn, if you were to happen to contract COVID from that exposure.
> 
> Another situation where masking is recommended is on the CDC's website, if you happen to be in a county where the rates of COVID 19 are very high, as we talk about on the website, wearing a mask is an additional layer of protection that you can take to keep yourself safe, to keep others around you safe.
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [01:04:03]
> 
> So we have several strategies for really learning what's happening in the U.S. with, not only the COVID vaccine, but other vaccines like influenza and RSV. 
> 
> So through various mechanisms, through our national immunization survey, through our immunization systems that jurisdictions have, we're able to get a view of what's happening with vaccine. 
> 
> We also, from the perspective of distribution, also know what's happening with our Bridge program, as well as VFC, and have also been in very close contact with commercial distributors, as well as manufacturers to get a sense of how commercial distribution is also moving. 
> 
> So the answer is lots of different strategies to identify how best to understand what's happening with vaccine on the ground, in the U.S. and more to come. 
> 
> As you heard from Dr. Cohen, the transparency is a really significant piece of our strategy. And, as these data become available, we'll be sharing the best data that we have around the progress of our vaccine campaign in the U.S.
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [01:07:14]
> 
> So I think as you heard from Dr. Shah already, nirsevimab is on the VFC formulary. And so it is available for VFC providers to order. 
> 
> We are also in close contact with the commercial manufacturer, as well as other distributors. And the commercial component of nirsevimab is also going to be launching as we speak, now and over the next few days. So, since the majority of this immunization is gonna be distributed through the commercial market, we will continue to support the effort as well as making sure that that there's clear guidance as to how this can be used in our youngest folks to prevent RSV. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Dylan George, CDC [01:08:19]
> 
> Before the end of the public health emergency ended, we were using case counts. We were using hospitalizations. And we were using death counts to anticipate what was the trajectory on both of those going forward. 
> 
> Now that the public health emergency has ended, we're focusing on hospitalization data. Those are the best data that we're using right now to actually help us anticipate what's going forward right now. 
> 
> And we're looking at a range of other data sources like wastewater or mobility data, or things along those lines, to see if they can be useful going forward. 
> 
> But right now, the mainstay is the hospitalization data.
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [01:11:09]
> 
> With the end of the public health emergency and the commercialization of vaccines, of COVID vaccines, we don't have the same degree of insight as to who is stocking vaccines and who's offering them particularly at the county level. 
> 
> However, the one area where we do have insight down to the provider level is through the Bridge Access Program. One of the requirements to be part of the Bridge Access Program for providers is that they list their availability of vaccine on the Vaccines dot gov website. 
> 
> And so if you're in a particular county and you're looking for vaccine down to the zip code level, I'd urge you to go to Vaccines dot gov. That's a starting point, particularly for those who are looking for a free vaccine from the Bridge Access Program. 
> 
> If you're looking for something a bit broader than that, you may have to check different providers websites, but if the focus is on finding a Bridge Access Program provider down to the zip code level, Vaccines dot gov is a great place to start.
> 
> ...
> 
> Kevin Griffis, CDC [01:13:51]
> 
> Will there be recommendation of changes for isolation for those who are COVID 19 positive?
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [01:13:57]
> 
> So, at this time we don't foresee that there's going to be a change in the isolation recommendations.

## CDC director's remarks at briefing on fall respiratory virus season

- **Source:** briefing hosted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
- **Date:** broadcasted October 4, 2023

> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:05:12]
> 
> We're just a few weeks into having the updated COVID vaccine, but already 4 million Americans have rolled up their sleeves in September and are better protected from COVID. That's pretty much on par with last fall's vaccination campaign. 
> 
> We know that more than 10 million vaccines have shipped to pharmacies and other locations. And we know that Americans, now, 90% of them at least are within five miles of a vaccine site. So that's all really good news. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:05:40]
> 
> We also have other tools to protect ourselves like tests. And we know that 42 million people have already ordered their free tests from COVID Tests dot gov, and they're already shipping to households around the country. So that's great news.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:07:02]
> 
> Too often, we are sacrificing understanding for precision. So we really need to continue to strive to simplify our guidance. And that is work we need to do both at the CDC, but we need your help in that to provide clear actions that people can take. 
> 
> So the top line message you're gonna hear over and over today and beyond is this.
> 
> The most effective way to protect yourself from the worst outcomes of this season's viruses is to get your fall vaccines. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:09:34]
> 
> Equitable access to free COVID 19 vaccines going to be more challenging this season, now that the federal government doesn't manage the whole process. Those are our realities and we have to be transparent about it, but we also have to work to address those challenges, using data and best practices and opportunities like this to build relationships with you, those who are working with our communities across the country.

## From a Novavax spokesperson regarding updated COVID-19 vaccine

- **Source:** emails from a Novavax spokesperson
- **Date:** received October 3, 2023

> For attribution to Novavax:
> 
> Today, the U.S. FDA authorized the first and only protein-based non-mRNA updated COVID-19 vaccine for use in people aged 12 years and older, developed by Novavax, using traditional vaccine technology. This adds a second technology option to the country’s public health arsenal to help protect individuals and their families against the XBB variant this fall. Novavax expects doses will be available in thousands of locations in the U.S., across pharmacies, physician offices and public health clinics, as well as through government entities including the Bridge Access Program and Vaccines for Children, in the coming days.
> 
> Now that EUA has been received, Novavax anticipates the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will issue updated recommendations for use of Novavax’s vaccine imminently. 
> 
> John Jacobs, President and Chief Executive Officer, Novavax, said: “COVID-19 is once again on the rise with infections and hospitalizations increasing, so it’s important that individuals get vaccinated to protect themselves and their loved ones. Novavax’s authorization today means people will now have the choice of a protein-based non-MRNA option to help protect themselves against COVID-19, which is now the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. In the coming days, individuals in the U.S. can go to major pharmacies, physicians’ offices, clinics and various government entities to receive an updated Novavax vaccine.” 
> 
> More information on availability can be found at us.novavaxcovidvaccine.com or vaccines.gov. Press release to follow.
> 
> ...
> 
> Please find below our responses and for attribution to Novavax.
> 
> When will the first Novavax vaccines be available for vaccinators? How many doses is Novavax planning to distribute this week?
>
> Millions of doses of Novavax’s vaccine have been in U.S. warehouses since September 11. Now that we have EUA, we await CBER batch release which is anticipated in the coming days. Once batches are released, we will immediately ship and are working to have product on shelves and ready for administration immediately, pending the timing of the dose release.
> 
> Since mid-September, when the other updated COVID vaccines were greenlighted, what were the additional issues Novavax needed to address with FDA for its EUA?
>
> Novavax worked closely with the FDA on this EUA to ensure that a protein-based option is part of the fall vaccine offering. Doses of Novavax’s COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted (2023-2024 Formula) arrived in U.S. warehouses September 11 as planned and are ready to ship to customers following CBER batch release.

## Official statement from Infinant Health

- **Source:** email from spokesperson at Leidar on behalf of Infinant Health
- **Date:** received October 2, 2023

> I’m reaching out on behalf of Infinant Health regarding your recently published article. Please see below for an official statement from the company, which can be attributed to “An official spokesperson for Infinant Health.” If you could please confirm receipt of this email, it would be greatly appreciated.
> 
> Official Statement from Infinant Health
> 
> “At Infinant Health consumer and patient safety is our top priority. Our products are manufactured to high standards of safety and quality to deliver important nutritional benefits for full term infants.
> 
> Through ongoing discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration, we have agreed to stop shipping and voluntarily recall our probiotic Evivo with MCT Oil. That product was used by healthcare professionals in hospital settings, including neonatal care for preterm infants. FDA recently issued a warning letter objecting to the use of Evivo with MCT Oil and all other probiotics in preterm infants. We have notified medical practitioners and hospitals of our recall and the FDA warning letter.
> 
> FDA also issued a letter to healthcare practitioners advising them that probiotics can pose serious risks to preterm infants, and that the agency is investigating the death of an extremely low birth weight infant who was given Evivo with MCT Oil as part of in-hospital care. We are cooperating with FDA’s ongoing investigation. Any questions about that investigation should be directed to FDA.
> 
> Evivo powder product, available on the commercial market for consumer purchase, is not the subject of FDA’s investigation and is not being recalled. The powder product has been proven to offer significant nutritional benefits to full term infants through the gut microbiome and has been embraced by many in the pediatric care community. Evivo powder is manufactured in compliance with food safety requirements and has been certified by the Clean Label Project to help ensure its purity.
> 
> Our company of distinguished scientists, clinicians, and parents stand behind the safety and quality of our products for full term infants. We intend to work with the FDA toward approval of the use of our MCT oil product in hospital settings.”
