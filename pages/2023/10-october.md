## CDC officials at briefing on fall respiratory virus season

- **Source:** briefing hosted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
- **Date:** broadcasted October 4, 2023

> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:35:14]
> 
> All three channels are open and available right now, and more and more sites are being added every single day. Indeed, it's one thing to talk about access, but we have to make sure that the pharmacy locations in particular are up and running as well as geographically spread around the country. 
> 
> As of last week, there were close to 19,000 pharmacy locations, comprising both Walgreens and CVS locations across the country. And as I mentioned, more and more sites are coming online every day, particularly independent pharmacies who have partnered with our colleagues at eTrueNorth to come online to make sure that vaccine is offered in places, for example, where there isn't as much coverage from Walgreens and CVS. 
> 
> So please, please note that if there's not a a location in your part of the part of the country right now, there may be in the near future as more and more independent pharmacies come online. That's on the pharmacy channel.
> 
> On the provider channel more and more channels are again coming online. And they're also increasing the administration of the vaccine that they're offering. 
> 
> As of just last week, over 6,600 pharmacy locations have administered at least one dose. And over 2,000 of the public health providers have placed at least a single order for COVID vaccines. 
> 
> Again, both of those sets of numbers are increasing week on week as more providers come online and they start ordering and administering vaccine. 
> 
> 
> ...
> 
> Kevin Griffis, CDC [00:42:43]
> 
> We've developed a suite of core messages to educate consumers around the fall and winter virus season, the importance of vaccination and other key preventative behaviors. 
> 
> We know that vaccination is the best way to stay protected against flu, COVID 19 and RSV, but there are other things we can do to help prevent the spread of viruses that includes covering cough and sneezes, frequent hand washing and staying home when sick, if you're able. We can go to the next slide.
> 
> Leaning into what we learned during our research, we developed an umbrella creative concept for our communications effort, our creative approach, which you'll see in a moment leverages emotional ties to loved ones as the key motivator to prevent respiratory diseases, amid fall and winter gathering season, while increasing awareness and perception of severity using a holistic prevention approach to counterbalance pandemic fatigue, and concerns around fear mongering for increased receptivity educates. 
> 
> It educates audiences about virus prevention behaviors, including masks and ventilation, and using icons as a tool while elevating vaccination as a key prevention strategy.  
> 
> With that, I will share a preview of our efforts, which are slated to launch in mid-October. What you'll see today is only a handful of assets that will be part of a larger effort, which with more iterations currently in development, as we continue to build out more assets that will go in the market through the end of the year.
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [00:49:41]
> 
> So first I want to just put a little bit of context, which is that the largest vaccine program in the history of the U.S. transitioned on September 12th from U.S. government distribution to commercial, that's a major milestone. 
> 
> A year of planning was critical in getting ready for this. And what we learned is that public health distribution of vaccine is a lot different than commercial distribution of the vaccine. And so what we saw was a gradual increase and are seeing a day by day and week by week increase in availability of vaccine in all of the many venues that you've heard about, whether they're pharmacies, medical providers, or other other folks who are vaccinators. 
> 
> So, we've been working really closely with all other parts of government, with other agencies, but also with the manufacturers of the vaccine, as well as the distributors, to really make sure that in this very historic shift in how this vaccine is distributed, that we're really making sure that we're getting the vaccine to folks who need it the most, specifically, thinking about folks who are at increased risk of complications from COVID 19, specifically older individuals, as well as some younger. 
> 
> So really, a lot of focus on, as we make this transition, really make sure that we're focusing on the folks that we serve and making sure the backseat is getting where it needs to get. I'll add on top of that, the Bridge program that you heard about in a lot of detail and Vaccines for Children have also been really critical in making sure that the vaccines that we do control in the U.S. government are getting to folks who need them.
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:51:19]
> 
> We're aware that folks have perhaps gone to a provider or a pharmacy hoping to have a vaccine for themselves or for their child, and there wasn't a vaccine there, and we're aware of those concerns and certainly those reports.
> 
> My message for folks who are in that, who have had that experience, is twofold. 
> 
> The first is please don't give up on the vaccine. Please know that vaccine is available, and as Demetre just mentioned, more and more vaccine is getting out there every single day, every single week. And so please check back in with your provider with your pharmacist, because it's likely if they didn't have vaccine two weeks ago, they will have it or have it now.
> 
> The second message is please know that the CDC is working on this. When we started receiving these reports, we, as Demetre said, made sure we were working with all of the different folks who were involved in the supply chain of vaccines to see what we could do to help lift barriers, or get folks together in the same room to try to solve the problem. 
> 
> The situation is getting better every single day. We know that that didn't-- we know that that meant that some folks maybe didn't have a shot waiting for them the day that they went.
> 
> But please know that there is a vaccine out there with your name on it.
> 
> ...
> 
> Kevin Griffis, CDC [00:52:41]
> 
> I know you're planning to update the forecast and I just wanted to get a sense of if you're seeing anything new and if there's anything notable that people should be aware of.
> 
> Dylan George, CDC [00:52:50]
> 
> There's a handful of uncertainties associated with trying to make these assessments going forward. 
> 
> And as I mentioned, the three big uncertainties that we're laser focused on is: is there a variant that would change our assessment of the epidemiological situation? And we're not seeing anything like that out there right now. 
> 
> The second one is, are we seeing a coincidence of the peaks of RSV, influenza and COVID coming together at some point. We're not seeing that either. 
> 
> And then the last one, are we seeing a particularly bad or severe flu season where you're seeing a lot of people requiring hospitalization? Fortunately right now there's low flu activity. We're not seeing that.
> 
> But we need to stay vigilant and watch all three areas. As I had mentioned before, we're learning more about each of these pathogens on a daily basis. As we learn more, we will update our assessments and we will update you at that time as well.
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [01:02:47]
> 
> We talk a lot about having tools this season and masking is and remains one of those tools. And I think what's most important to think about with respect to masking is making sure that we are creating space for anyone who wants to mask to be able to do so. 
> 
> Now there are a few situations in where, in which masking is important and situations that CDC recommend folks mask. 
> 
> One of them, for example, is after you've been exposed. And all of this is on our website, but after you've been exposed to someone who definitely had COVID, wearing a mask after that is a great way to limit the likelihood that you might accidentally expose someone in turn, if you were to happen to contract COVID from that exposure.
> 
> Another situation where masking is recommended is on the CDC's website, if you happen to be in a county where the rates of COVID 19 are very high, as we talk about on the website, wearing a mask is an additional layer of protection that you can take to keep yourself safe, to keep others around you safe.
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [01:04:03]
> 
> So we have several strategies for really learning what's happening in the U.S. with, not only the COVID vaccine, but other vaccines like influenza and RSV. 
> 
> So through various mechanisms, through our national immunization survey, through our immunization systems that jurisdictions have, we're able to get a view of what's happening with vaccine. 
> 
> We also, from the perspective of distribution, also know what's happening with our Bridge program, as well as VFC, and have also been in very close contact with commercial distributors, as well as manufacturers to get a sense of how commercial distribution is also moving. 
> 
> So the answer is lots of different strategies to identify how best to understand what's happening with vaccine on the ground, in the U.S. and more to come. 
> 
> As you heard from Dr. Cohen, the transparency is a really significant piece of our strategy. And, as these data become available, we'll be sharing the best data that we have around the progress of our vaccine campaign in the U.S.
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [01:07:14]
> 
> So I think as you heard from Dr. Shah already, nirsevimab is on the VFC formulary. And so it is available for VFC providers to order. 
> 
> We are also in close contact with the commercial manufacturer, as well as other distributors. And the commercial component of nirsevimab is also going to be launching as we speak, now and over the next few days. So, since the majority of this immunization is gonna be distributed through the commercial market, we will continue to support the effort as well as making sure that that there's clear guidance as to how this can be used in our youngest folks to prevent RSV. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Dylan George, CDC [01:08:19]
> 
> Before the end of the public health emergency ended, we were using case counts. We were using hospitalizations. And we were using death counts to anticipate what was the trajectory on both of those going forward. 
> 
> Now that the public health emergency has ended, we're focusing on hospitalization data. Those are the best data that we're using right now to actually help us anticipate what's going forward right now. 
> 
> And we're looking at a range of other data sources like wastewater or mobility data, or things along those lines, to see if they can be useful going forward. 
> 
> But right now, the mainstay is the hospitalization data.
> 
> ...
> 
> Nirav Shah, CDC [01:11:09]
> 
> With the end of the public health emergency and the commercialization of vaccines, of COVID vaccines, we don't have the same degree of insight as to who is stocking vaccines and who's offering them particularly at the county level. 
> 
> However, the one area where we do have insight down to the provider level is through the Bridge Access Program. One of the requirements to be part of the Bridge Access Program for providers is that they list their availability of vaccine on the Vaccines dot gov website. 
> 
> And so if you're in a particular county and you're looking for vaccine down to the zip code level, I'd urge you to go to Vaccines dot gov. That's a starting point, particularly for those who are looking for a free vaccine from the Bridge Access Program. 
> 
> If you're looking for something a bit broader than that, you may have to check different providers websites, but if the focus is on finding a Bridge Access Program provider down to the zip code level, Vaccines dot gov is a great place to start.
> 
> ...
> 
> Kevin Griffis, CDC [01:13:51]
> 
> Will there be recommendation of changes for isolation for those who are COVID 19 positive?
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [01:13:57]
> 
> So, at this time we don't foresee that there's going to be a change in the isolation recommendations. 


## CDC director's remarks at briefing on fall respiratory virus season

- **Date:** broadcasted October 4, 2023

> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:05:12]
> 
> We're just a few weeks into having the updated COVID vaccine, but already 4 million Americans have rolled up their sleeves in September and are better protected from COVID. That's pretty much on par with last fall's vaccination campaign. 
> 
> We know that more than 10 million vaccines have shipped to pharmacies and other locations. And we know that Americans, now, 90% of them at least are within five miles of a vaccine site. So that's all really good news. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:05:40]
> 
> We also have other tools to protect ourselves like tests. And we know that 42 million people have already ordered their free tests from COVID Tests dot gov, and they're already shipping to households around the country. So that's great news.
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:07:02]
> 
> Too often, we are sacrificing understanding for precision. So we really need to continue to strive to simplify our guidance. And that is work we need to do both at the CDC, but we need your help in that to provide clear actions that people can take. 
> 
> So the top line message you're gonna hear over and over today and beyond is this.
> 
> The most effective way to protect yourself from the worst outcomes of this season's viruses is to get your fall vaccines. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:09:34]
> 
> Equitable access to free COVID 19 vaccines going to be more challenging this season, now that the federal government doesn't manage the whole process. Those are our realities and we have to be transparent about it, but we also have to work to address those challenges, using data and best practices and opportunities like this to build relationships with you, those who are working with our communities across the country.

## From a Novavax spokesperson regarding updated COVID-19 vaccine

- **Source:** emails from a Novavax spokesperson
- **Date:** received October 3, 2023

> For attribution to Novavax:
> 
> Today, the U.S. FDA authorized the first and only protein-based non-mRNA updated COVID-19 vaccine for use in people aged 12 years and older, developed by Novavax, using traditional vaccine technology. This adds a second technology option to the country’s public health arsenal to help protect individuals and their families against the XBB variant this fall. Novavax expects doses will be available in thousands of locations in the U.S., across pharmacies, physician offices and public health clinics, as well as through government entities including the Bridge Access Program and Vaccines for Children, in the coming days.
> 
> Now that EUA has been received, Novavax anticipates the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will issue updated recommendations for use of Novavax’s vaccine imminently. 
> 
> John Jacobs, President and Chief Executive Officer, Novavax, said: “COVID-19 is once again on the rise with infections and hospitalizations increasing, so it’s important that individuals get vaccinated to protect themselves and their loved ones. Novavax’s authorization today means people will now have the choice of a protein-based non-MRNA option to help protect themselves against COVID-19, which is now the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. In the coming days, individuals in the U.S. can go to major pharmacies, physicians’ offices, clinics and various government entities to receive an updated Novavax vaccine.” 
> 
> More information on availability can be found at us.novavaxcovidvaccine.com or vaccines.gov. Press release to follow.
> 
> ...
> 
> Please find below our responses and for attribution to Novavax.
> 
> When will the first Novavax vaccines be available for vaccinators? How many doses is Novavax planning to distribute this week?
>
> Millions of doses of Novavax’s vaccine have been in U.S. warehouses since September 11. Now that we have EUA, we await CBER batch release which is anticipated in the coming days. Once batches are released, we will immediately ship and are working to have product on shelves and ready for administration immediately, pending the timing of the dose release.
> 
> Since mid-September, when the other updated COVID vaccines were greenlighted, what were the additional issues Novavax needed to address with FDA for its EUA?
>
> Novavax worked closely with the FDA on this EUA to ensure that a protein-based option is part of the fall vaccine offering. Doses of Novavax’s COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted (2023-2024 Formula) arrived in U.S. warehouses September 11 as planned and are ready to ship to customers following CBER batch release.

## Official statement from Infinant Health

- **Source:** email from spokesperson at Leidar on behalf of Infinant Health
- **Date:** received October 2, 2023

> I’m reaching out on behalf of Infinant Health regarding your recently published article. Please see below for an official statement from the company, which can be attributed to “An official spokesperson for Infinant Health.” If you could please confirm receipt of this email, it would be greatly appreciated.
> 
> Official Statement from Infinant Health
> 
> “At Infinant Health consumer and patient safety is our top priority. Our products are manufactured to high standards of safety and quality to deliver important nutritional benefits for full term infants.
> 
> Through ongoing discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration, we have agreed to stop shipping and voluntarily recall our probiotic Evivo with MCT Oil. That product was used by healthcare professionals in hospital settings, including neonatal care for preterm infants. FDA recently issued a warning letter objecting to the use of Evivo with MCT Oil and all other probiotics in preterm infants. We have notified medical practitioners and hospitals of our recall and the FDA warning letter.
> 
> FDA also issued a letter to healthcare practitioners advising them that probiotics can pose serious risks to preterm infants, and that the agency is investigating the death of an extremely low birth weight infant who was given Evivo with MCT Oil as part of in-hospital care. We are cooperating with FDA’s ongoing investigation. Any questions about that investigation should be directed to FDA.
> 
> Evivo powder product, available on the commercial market for consumer purchase, is not the subject of FDA’s investigation and is not being recalled. The powder product has been proven to offer significant nutritional benefits to full term infants through the gut microbiome and has been embraced by many in the pediatric care community. Evivo powder is manufactured in compliance with food safety requirements and has been certified by the Clean Label Project to help ensure its purity.
> 
> Our company of distinguished scientists, clinicians, and parents stand behind the safety and quality of our products for full term infants. We intend to work with the FDA toward approval of the use of our MCT oil product in hospital settings.”
